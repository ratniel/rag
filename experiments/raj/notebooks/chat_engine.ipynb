      "Abhyanga is an Ayurvedic massage therapy that involves massaging the body with warm, medicated oils. It is typically done in the morning after sunrise and can be done daily for healthy individuals. The type of oil used depends on the season and the individual's constitution. The massage should be done in a specific direction and for a specific amount of time to achieve the desired benefits. These benefits include reducing fatigue, improving circulation, strengthening the skin, and promoting relaxation. Abhyanga can also be used as a pre-procedure for Panchakarma, a more intensive Ayurvedic detoxification therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the steps on how to perform Abhyanga:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Prepare the body by evacuating the bowels and urine.\n",
      "2. Choose the appropriate oil based on the season and the individual's constitution.\n",
      "3. Warm the oil and apply it to the body in a lukewarm state.\n",
      "4. Massage the body in an Anuloma direction, which is in the direction of hair growth.\n",
      "5. Massage the joints in a circular direction.\n",
      "6. Massage the muscles in the direction of their origin and insertion.\n",
      "7. Massage the lymphatic drainage system in the direction of the lymph nodes.\n",
      "8. Massage the vital parts, such as the heart and lungs, with care.\n",
      "9. Massage the whole body for at least 15 to 35 minutes.\n",
      "10. When massaging a specific part of the body, massage for at least 5 minutes.\n",
      "11. Give the patient the following positions sequentially:\n",
      "    * Sitting position with legs stretched completely.\n",
      "    * Sleeping in a supine position.\n",

      "16. Use an astringent substance to remove any excess oil.\n",
      "\n",
