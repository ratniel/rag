Introduction:
Heavy diet or food in
large quantity hampers Agni (digestive
capacity). That leads to formation of Aama,
vitiation of Dosha and manifestation
of symptoms, collectively called as Aamadosha.


Definition of Aama: 
Ushman`o Alpa Balatvena Dhaatum Aadyam
Apaachitam |
Dusht`am Aamaas`hayagatam Rasam Aamam
Prachakshate || A. H.
Su. 13/25

Aama
is formed due to decreased digestive capacity. In the process of digestion, Rasa
Dhaatu remains
undigested and gets vitiated. This vitiated Rasa remains in the Aamaas`haya
causing various symptoms and diseases. This is called as Aama Dosha. 


Causes of Aamadosha:
Diet consumed in
large amount than the hunger, it is called Atimaatraas`hana, which is cause of
aggravation of all the three Dosha. 
When a person
consumes food in a large amount, and drinks water after consumption, due to the
irritation caused by the excess food all the three Dosha get aggravated. 
Not only excess food
quantity is responsible for Aama Dosha
but the food having attributes like Guru,
Rooksha, S`heeta etc. also causes Aama
Dosha. Though the food is taken in proper amount, factors like Chintaa etc. are also responsible for Aama Dosha 
If all the Dosha are vitiated and they get accumulated,
then intermingle to produce Aama as
poison is formed from the Kodrava. 

Sampraapti of Aamadosha:
Agni
Dusht`ee is basic
cause of Aamadosha. 
Due to hampered digestive capacity, though light
food is consumed it is not digested then it resembles to S`hukta (fermented substance) and turns to Anna Visha. 
These Dosha
get mixed with the undigested food. They remain there without any movement (Alasaka) or suddenly they get purged out
either through the mouth or through the anus (Visoochikaa). Thus, they create different types of Vyaadhi. 
Anna Visha (food turned into poison) gets associated with Pitta, then it manifests with Daaha, Trishn`aa, Mukhaamaya (diseases
of oral cavity), Amlapitta and other
diseases due to Pitta. If it gets
associated with Kapha, then it
manifests in Yakshmaa, Peenasa, Meha and other Kapha predominant diseases.
