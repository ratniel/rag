Trends in Basti Management</h1>
<h3><u5:p></u5:p>Dr. Yadaiah Polepally.</h3>
<p>M.D., Ph.D<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p><u5:p></u5:p>Ayurveda considers
fats, medicated oils as tissues-protectors. The advice of applications of such
material is spread all over the texts. Instead of application to the skin, only
the warm oils and decoctions are allowed to dwell in hollows of the body for a
stipulated period. By dwelling in they come in contact with the specific mucous
membrane, improvise the structure and thus function in that locality. So the
method of making a material to dwell in the hollow, facility to be in and such
interventive material is called Basti. The majority of such
push-to-dwell in are through the rectum in the large intestines, and they are
mistranslated as enema. The intention of enema is mostly of introduction of
some irritant / secretogogue,
volume to hasten movement of obstructed contents outside; the intention in
administering Basti is to dwell
inside for a much longer spell, so that absorption of the interventive material
can augment the capacity of the organ. The entry is mainly through three
orifices:<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>Pakvaas`haya (Large intestines) through rectum; or <u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>Into Garbhaas`haya (Uterus) through vagina or <u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>Into Mootraas`haya (Bladder) through urethra. It is done with the help
of Basti Yantra and it can be called as intra-rectal. <u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p><u5:p></u5:p>According to modern
science enema is said to be the cleaning of the large intestines and rectum
with the help of soap water or warm water whenever a patient gets constipation.
In Basti there are many food items
rather than only irritants introduced into the body. The dominant mixture
ingredients are mainly of two varieties of I.R. (2). <u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>Anuvaasana (Predominance of oils
or ghee) and <u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>Nirooha (less oil and more decoction of herbs)<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p><u5:p></u5:p>Maatraa Basti is one of the varieties of Anuvaasana Basti and it is one of the
safest and least uncomplicated. Its volume is very small, equal to 60 ml
approximately. It is indicated in all clinical conditions, where building of
tissues is the need arising out of less nourishment (Apatarpan`ajanya Vyaadhi) (3)<u5:p></u5:p></p>

<p>i) The Patient should be asked to
pass urine and stools to avoid chance of uncontrolled evacuation or undue
holding.<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>ii) Oil massage should be done to the whole
body or locally i.e. back, abdomen and buttocks for 10 to15 minutes.<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>iii) Hot fomentation
should be given with controlled medicated steam by a tube or with a hot water
bag for 10 to 15 minutes.<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p><u5:p></u5:p><u5:p></u5:p>Pradhaana
Karma (Main procedure): -<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p><u5:p></u5:p>i) The patient should lie down on the table
on his left side, flexing the right hip and knee, and putting on his left
leg.<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>ii) Warm medicated oil mixed with 1 gram of rock salt.<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>iii) Warm medicated oil should be taken into a syringe and
the catheter must be fixed by removing the air completely from it by pressing
the piston of the syringe.<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>iv) After applying oil to the anus insert oil-smeared
catheter, slowly into anus up to 3" length, and then slowly and gently

<p>OPD patient
should be allowed to go home and take rest.<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>When the patient gets a good
appetite, he should be given hot and fresh lentil-rice (Khichad`i) combination. <u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>Hot water should be given
throughout the treatment period.<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>For O.P.D. patients, however, care
should be taken to avoid physical as well as mental strain.<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>The patient
should be advised to sleep early.<u5:p></u5:p></p>

<p><u5:p></u5:p><u5:p></u5:p>NIROOHA
BASTI:<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>Due to the
more absorbable ingredients, Anuvaasana is to dwell in the body for a longer
period. With repetition of these, there is the necessity to
clear the extra oily component. For this the medicated decoctions, administered
in between; cleanse, Dosha_s and Mala_s from the body. This is known as Nirooha - one responsible for doing away
extra oiliness, due to continued Basti_s.
Care must be taken that Anuvaasana should
be given before and after the Nirooha
Basti. The Basti, which is
dominant in decoction, instead of oils, fats; is also known as Kashaaya Basti. Due to its beneficial
effect on a longer span of life, it has been called, Aasthaapana Basti.<u5:p></u5:p></p>

properly keep in hot water-bath, to maintain warmth, for use.<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p><u5:p></u5:p>Before administration
of S`hodhana the patient should have
had Anuvaasana earlier.<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p><u5:p></u5:p><u5:p></u5:p>Pradhaana Karma (Main procedure): - be sure that the patient comes with an empty stomach.<u5:p></u5:p></p>

<p><u5:p></u5:p>Reassure the patient, inquire about any pain,
and advise rest, at least for two hours. With proper appetite, rice munga
preparation, freshly cooked along with warm water to drink, should
be advised throughout the treatment. In the evening, a hot and light diet is
advised. In the situation of no passage of stools, once again he is
administered S`hodhana in larger
quantity. The next day morning the patient should continue Anuvaasana Basti.<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<h6><u5:p></u5:p>Uses: -<u5:p></u5:p></h6>
<p>By improvising the area responsible for absorption, by
proper separation of sticky layers, there is cleansing of all the channels,
fluid exchange mechanism gets toned up; extra Dosha_s are propagated outside, whereby the strength of tissues is
improved. It results in rejuvenation, which improves longevity and memory and
complexion too. <u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p><u5:p></u5:p>By nature it is antiVaata procedure, and by maximizing tissue wear tear it normalizes
other components too.<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p><u5:p></u5:p>Basti is the choicest remedy to
compensate the effects of Vaata exacerbation
as termed Vaataharaan`aam Shresht`ham" (6) and
therefore it is the best therapy to treat all Vaata Vyaadhi_s and Aachaarya
Sus`hrita aptly described that, it is useful not only for Vaata, but also for Pitta, Kapha, Rakta and in complex combination of two,
three (Samsarga and Sannipaata) Dosha_s (7)<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p><u5:p></u5:p>Basti is not similar to enema, because
of its nourishing potential; hence it should not to be misunderstood as enema. Basti, management is labeled as total
(for Kaaya Chikitsaa) and of entire
management in Ayurveda.<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p><u5:p></u5:p><u5:p></u5:p>Pharmaco Dynamics
of Basti<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p> <u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>Using the simple examples of daily life easily does the
explanations of actions. Intra Rectal, dominate in food items rather than
medicinals. The tissues on the verge of weakness are refreshed / rejuvenated by
courses of intra-rectals. It is compared to watering of a dry plant, to have
the recovery of the turgid cells once again. As the actions are noted at so
many levels of tissues regeneration, broad spectrum is probably the most
appropriate term. It acts as Rasaayana (to
rejuvenate,) Vrishya (Aphrodisiac); Brimhan`a (Anabolic) because of its
capacities to contribute to the building of tissues; and it is indicated in a (Kris`ha) or emaciated persons to
increase the quality and quantity of Dhaatu_s;
and in (Sthaulya) obesity to
streamline the unwanted obesity components (9). The clinically observed effects
at times surprise the scientists, especially in background of prevalently
accepted medical sciences. A volume of fat, with or without herbal decoction,
with temperatures around 38-43 degree Celsius, allowed to dwell in the lower
zone of gastro-intestinal tract; for a stipulated bearable period, produces a
spectrum of actions. But the area of Apaana-Vaata by its controlling capacity of
rest Vaata types, does so. Here it is
the distinct concept is to be digested, rather than pharmacological action of
the substance dwelling in. Basti_s show
significant results in almost all diseases, by its very distinct actions on Vaata zone. The fact is therefore
explained with suitable analogies. : <u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p> Trees are
irrigated at its root level, and in due course of time, develop branches rich with
beautiful tender leaves, flowers and fruits. So the administered decoction in
the rectum, due to the main absorbing area, (Guda) produces results positive from head to toe 10) (11). (See
illustration) <u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p><u5:p></u5:p><u5:p></u5:p><u5:p></u5:p><u5:p></u5:p><u5:p></u5:p><u5:p></u5:p><u5:p></u5:p><u5:p></u5:p><u5:p></u5:p><u5:p></u5:p>Basti
eliminates
the vitiated Dosha_s. Medicines,
which are administered through the rectal route, are absorbed in the rectum and
large intestines. The rectum has rich blood and lymph supply and drugs can
cross through the rectal mucosa like
other lipid membranes. Aachaarya Paaras`hara opined long ago, anus (Guda) is the main route of the body
having blood vessels in it, nourishes the whole body. The technical term for
this part of the track is Paayu. i.e.
one which is capable of absorbing oil through its layers, is the grammatical
derivation of the term; the most appropriate.<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p> The
superior haemorrhoidal veins in the
portal circulation carry the portion, which is absorbed from the upper rectal
mucosa, whereas the middle and inferior haemorrhoidal veins absorb from the lower rectal mucosa, and thus enters
directly into the Systemic Circulation.<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p><u5:p></u5:p> The rectum with its vascularity and venous plexus provides a good
circulation, producing the effects more quickly without affecting the liver
where they may be differently metabolized. <u5:p></u5:p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><u5:p></u5:p><u5:p></u5:p><u5:p></u5:p><u5:p></u5:p>Soon
after the intake, to facilitate digestion at proximal part, the pyloric
sphincter contracts for proper digestion. The Kapha`s transient dominance, in Kapha-Prapaaka stage extends due to Anuvaasana particularly and enhances the
(Brimhan`a) tissue - building
effect.<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p><u5:p></u5:p>The alimentary canal
is open on both sides. With any intake automatically the pyloric sphincter
tightly closes, and by intra-rectal at the same time the chances of dwelling in
are increased to achieve tissue building.<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p><u5:p></u5:p><u5:p></u5:p>Pharmacodynamics of S`hodhana Basti: -<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p><u5:p></u5:p>The decoction
predominant Basti enters into the
large intestine, and gets absorbed a little earlier, as the contents are less
thick. The medicine component enhances elimination of waste materials, from tissue
level and brings to the hollow area to throw out from the body.<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p><u5:p></u5:p>In other words it can
be hypothetically explained that, being a hyper tonic solution (Nirooha Basti) after entering the large
intestines, the fluids may traverse because of osmosis from hypo tonic to hyper
tonic solutions i. e. fluid along with the unwanted
pathological material, dragged from intracellular and extra cellular level into
the large intestines and thrown out from the body. The choice of an empty
stomach for this is specific of S`hodhana Basti. Expected to come out with in (one Muhurta) 45min.to avoid many complications. S`hodhana Basti should be given on empty stomach
as explained in Aasthaapana Basti. <u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p><u5:p></u5:p>With Ayurvedaic
and other rationales so perused, the statements about, half or total
management, by intra-rectal, solely or only can be appreciated with certain
clinical evaluations.<u5:p></u5:p></p>

<p>To assess
the individual muscle power before and after the treatment, all the patients
were examined and graded according to the Medical Research Council (0-5)<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>Measurements of all the muscles were
noted before and after the treatment.<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>Body weight was recorded before as

<p><u5:p></u5:p>Conclusion: <u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>The study
has established that continuous Balaa
Taila Maatraa Basti is superior to other treatments for acute patients. The
statistical and even clinical results have indicated that the recovery is
faster than from other treatments. <u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>The study
has indicated that the muscles of the left knee extensors have gained
significant muscle power with continuous Balaa
Taila Maatraa Basti in acute cases.<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>The
clinical study revealed that the continuous Balaa
Taila Maatraa Basti in acute cases is superior to the other treatments,
particularly in the improvement of hip extensors of left side affected cases.<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>All the treatments
considered in this study have shown statistical significance by 5%, increase in
body weight.<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>Statistically
it has been proved that, all patients have gained the muscle power at 5% level.<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>Maatraa Basti has not shown any complications and side effects
during and after the treatment (Yadaiah1985).
<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p><u5:p></u5:p>II. In Pakshaaghaata
(paralysis) , there were significant results with courses of Bastis of As`hvagandhaa Ghrita and Vaata
Naas`haka Taila, muscle power
significantly increased and many patients become independent .<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>III As`hvagandhaa
Ghrita Basti has shown significant results in Sandhivaata (osteo Arthritis).<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>IV. Brihat
Saindhavaadi Taila has shown encouraging results in Aamavaata (Rheumatism) patients and laboratory investigations were
reported negative for R.A. and ASO titre in
number of cases.<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p><u5:p></u5:p><u5:p></u5:p>Lekhana Basti has shown significant reduction in body weight and lipid profile. In
this study, patients who possessed the signs and symptoms of Medoroga mentioned in Charaka Samhitaa as well as having a
body mass index more than 24 were selected for research trials. Following
investigations were done for every obesity patient before and after treatment i.e. blood for Hb%, blood sugar, serum cholesterol, and lipid profile and urine
examination. These patients were divided randomly into three groups:<u5:p></u5:p></p>

<p><u5:p></u5:p>Apart from the
present day prevalent managements for various conditions, addition or alone use
of textually indicated intra-rectal has number of benefits. All scientific
details cannot be included for want of place. Certain claims about shifting of
pathological values or texts to physiological ones are indicative of
therapeutic efficacy. Lekhana for
control of obesity; Maadhu Tailika for
control of neuro-muscular
stroke, situations; medicated milk administration by Basti for antacid potential; intra-rectal of volume of churned
gum-olio-resin of S`haalmaeei, in ulcerative irritational malabsorbtive conditions are a few taken from a long
list. <u5:p></u5:p></p>

<p>3. In present mechanical era the Maadhu Tailika Basti is a safest, uncomplicated and time saving
method of Basti and it is free from
untoward effects.<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>4. It has also seen that, this Basti can be administered in OPD level.<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>5. In G1 group, the significant raise in protein levels
(t+‑ 16.48 P&lt;0.10) and significant reductions in ESR levels (t+_
1.68;P&lt;0.10) were seemed. <u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>6. In G2 group, significant reduction was seen in Blood
sugar levels (t+_2.193; P&lt;0.05) and ESR levels (t+3.268; P&lt;0.01)<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>7. Significant increase in Hb% (t+_1.97; P&lt;0.05) was seen in G3 group.<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>8. Serum cholesterol levels have not shown any significant
change in any group.<u5:p></u5:p></p>
<p>9. Grading scale has shown statistically significant
