Due to lack of Agnibala (Weak digestive power), the partially undigested food, which remains in Aantra, vitiated due to Dosha is called as Aama. It is the root cause for the development of majority of intrinsic diseases. Saamaanya Chikitsaa: Apatarpan`a is advisable as primary treatment. Apatarpan`a is not advisable always. Following regime should be administered. Paachana, Deepana, Snehana and Svedana followed by the appropriate type of S`hodhana should be administered. For Deepana Paachana Sneha Dravya having Paachana property predominantly and Deepana property partially. Paachana results in digestion of Aama. Due to Deepana Aaama gets separated from the Dhaatu. Snehana results in Utkleshana. Svedana administered after this leads the movement of Aama towards the Kosht`ha. This Aama should now be eliminated out of the body through the nearest possible path by administering appropriate S`hodhana. S`hodhana For Aamaas`hayatha Aama -Through oral root For Urdhvajatrugata Aama - Through nasal root. For Pakvaashayastha Aama - Through anal root. Aavasthika Chikitsaa: Special Precautions (Chikitsaa Nishedha): S`hodhana Chikitsaa should be avoided in following conditions. S`hodhana Chikitsaa should be avoided in Saamadosha which are scattered all over the body (Leena) or clung to Dhaatu or which are not mobile (Anutklishat`a). Saamadosha which have spontaneously become mobile either upward or downwards should not be treated with S`hamana Chikitsaa. (Saama Dosha which have become spontaneously mobile and being eliminated from oral or anus should not be arrested in the initial stage) Properties of usual diet: Normally diet should be digested properly and there should not be any symptom like Hridaya Uparodha, Kukshee Peed`ana, Paars`hva Vipaat`ana, Udara Gaurava, or Indriya Apreen`ana. If diet is taken in a small amount, which does not fulfill hunger, then it is called Heenamaatraas`hana.

Ars`ha is difficult to cure. Patient suffers a lot from this disease. In complications, other organs are also involved. In Sushrut Samhitaa there is elaborative description about surgery of Ars`ha. Saamaanya Chikitsaa: General treatment of Ars`ha can be done by 4 methods Bheshaja - Achirakaalajaata Alpa Dosha Linga, Alpa Upadrava Kshaara Karma Mridu Prasrita Avagaad`ha Uchchhrita Agnikarma Karkas`ha, Sthira, Prithu, Kat`hina S`hastrakarma Tanumoola, Uchchhrita, Kledavanta Mainly the therapies which are Vaata, Kapha and Pitta Anulomaka and Agni Bala Vardhaka are beneficial for Ars`ha. The medicines and diet which relieve (Bhitvaa) the Vibandha (like Styaana Kapha), which are Vaataanulomaka and which stimulate the power of Agni should be advised. Diet Snigdha, Agnideepana, Ars`hoghna, Srist`a Mootra Pureesha (laxative) Ars`ha, Grahan`ee and Atisaara generally act as causes of one another. All these diseases manifest due to Agnimaandya and Agneedeepana is the first line of treatment for all these diseases. So the treatment of all these diseases consists mainly of all measures which are helpful to maintain Agneebala. Mainly the treatment should be according to the two main types of Ars`ha i.e. S`hushka and Sraavi Ars`ha. Aavasthika Chikitsaa: S`hushka Ars`ha - Vaata or Kapha Praadhaanya. Treated by Sveda, Dhoopa, Lepa, Abhyanga Due to these procedures the Dusht`a Rakta accumulated in the piles gets expelled out and the patient gets relief. If there is no relief from S`heeta, Snigdha and Rooksha treatment that means the cause is vitiated blood and it should be treated by Raktamokshan`a (blood letting). This should be done with the help of Jalaukaa, S`hastra or Soochee. S`hushka Ars`ha with Bhinna Varchas: Should be treated with Paachana Yoga mentioned in the treatment of Aamaatisaara. S`hushka Ars`ha with Guda S`hotha + S`hoola + Mandaagi: Should also be treated with Paachana Yoga_s mentioned in the treatment of Aamaatisaara. S`hushka Ars`ha with Gaad`ha Varchas: Should be treated with the measures which act as Vaata, Kapha and Pitta Anulomaka and increase the power of Agni. Sraavi Ars`ha Mainly Rakta or Pitta Praadhaanya Chikitsaa. Sraavi Ars`ha with Vaataanubandha Should be treated with measures having S`heeta and Snigdha properties. Sraavi Ars`ha with Kaphaanubandha - Should be treated with measures having S`heeta and Rooksha properties. Sraavi Ars`ha with Kapha and Pitta Praadhaanya S`hodhana. Sraavi Ars`ha + Dusht`a Raktasraava The bleeding should not be stopped and Langhana should be administered. If the vitiated blood is prematurely arrested then it may cause one or more of the following diseases Raktapitta, Jvara, Trishn`aa, Agnimaandya, Arochaka, Kaamalaa, Guda S`hotha, Guda S`hoola, Vankshan`a S`hoola, Vankshan`a S`hotha, Kan`d`oo, Kot`ha, Pid`akaa, Kusht`ha, Paan`d`u, Vaata Mootra Pureesha Vibandha, S`hirahs`hoola, Staimitya, Guru Gaatrataa, Raktapradoshaja Vyaadhee. The bleeding should be neglected unless there is an emergency. Sraavi Ars`ha + Sruta Dusht`a Rakta Rakta Sangrahan`a (measures to arrest bleeding). For this Tikta Rasa Pradhaana medicines should be administered which stimulate the power of Agni, stop bleeding and act as Dosha Paachaka. Sraavi Ars`ha + Raktasraava + Praksheen`a Dosha + Vaata Praadhaanya Snehapaana orally, by Abhyanga and Anuvaasana Basti. Sraavi Ars`ha + no Kapha Vaataanubandha + Pitta Praadhaanya + Greeshma Kaalaja Immediate Raktastambhana Sraavi Ars`ha + Rakta Pitta Praadhaanya + Alpa Kapha Vaata Treatment having S`heeta property. Even after administration of above mentioned treatment if bleeding continues following type of treatment aimed at Vaata S`hamana (as there is vitiation of Vaata Dosha due to Atiraktasraava )should be administered Tarpan`a should be done by administration of Snigdha, Ooshn`a Maamsarasa, Ghritapaana and sprinkling of Ksheera, Ghrita, or Taila. For the treatment of Ars`ha alternatively Madhura and Amla therapies and S`heeta and Ushn`a therapies should be administered. Special Precaution: Ars`ha should be treated immediately. Otherwise, it may lead to Baddha Gudodara obstructing anal canal. Treatment of other Ars`ha types: Generally Ars`ha means piles or hemorrhoids, various muscular growths like polyps are also described as Ars`ha due to similarity in pathogenesis. General treatment for other Ars`ha (Med`hraars`ha, Yoni Ars`ha, Naabhi Ars`ha, Netra Ars`ha etc) includes Bheshaja Kshaara Agnikarma S`hastrakarma For Karn`aars`ha, Naasaars`ha and Charmakeela please refer Karn`a Roga, Naasaa Roga and Kshudra Roga respectively.

Atisaara Introduction: Agnibalahaanee  hampered digestion capacity is the main cause in the manifestation of Atisaara hence Agni should be targeted for treatment. Atisaara should be treated after examining the Hetu, Upas`haya and Dosha Vis`hesha Avasthaa. Saamaanya Chikitsaa: Generally, Langhana and Paachana are advised for Atisaara. Considering specific Avasthaa, appropriate treatment should be suggested. Stambhana is contraindicated in Saama Avasthaa, while it can be indicated in Niraama stage. In all the types of Atisaara, Vaayu gets aggravated in the Pakvaas`haya, therefore it is necessary to pacify this aggravated Vaata. When all three vitiate, dominant Dosha should be pacified first of the order should be as follows: Vaata  Pitta  Kapha. Aavasthik Chikitsaa: Vaatahara Kriyaa Vaatahara Kriyaa Aas`hvaasana Vaatahara Kriyaa Harshan`a Sangrahan`a is contraindicated, at the start of the treatment as Dosha get accumulated, if Sangrahan`a is given prematurely; Vibandha and other diseases like Dan`d`aalasaka, Aadhmaana, Grahan`ee, Ars`ha, S`hotha, Paan`d`u, Pleehaa, Kusht`ha, Gulma, Udara, Jvara could be manifested. Therefore, it is necessary to avoid Sangrahan`a when Utklisht`a Dosha are being flushed out naturally. Dosha are going out with difficulty due to Aama; Abhayaa should be given. It eliminates the Dosha smoothly after converting them, thus pacifying Atisaara. As a result the body becomes light (Laghu) and the Agni gets increased. Langhana (fasting /restricted food in case of a Durbala Rugn`a) is to be observed till the Dosha get pacified. Patient should be given Laghu Aahaara (food which is light to digest), when patient feels hungry, which increases his Bala, Ruchi and Agni. Saatmya (habitual or suitable) food should be given. Aahaara which is Deepana (intensifying Agni), Graahee (which will arrest the hyperactivity of bowels) like Yavaagoo, Vilepee, Khad`a Yoosha, Rasaudana should be given. The food or drug should have attributes like Deepana, Paachana, Graahee, Balya, Rochana.

Every event in the nature and in human life is deeply affected by Kaala. Ayurveda emphasizes on the manifold effects of Kaala on human life. Dominance of Kaala is revealed in all the events; such as birth, growth, formation of the seasons, management of diseases, collection of the drugs etc. Types of Kaala: For the simplification of understanding Kaala is divided into two major types. (C.Vi.8/84): A) Aavasthika Kaala is concerned with diseased state (C.Vi.1/22) and with the milestones of the life such as childhood, teenage, old age etc. This type is also useful in treatment. (C.Chi.30/296) B) Nityaga Kaala is in relation with Maasa, Ritu, Samvatsara etc. (C.Vi.8/125) Aushadha Sevana Kaala is the time for the administration of the drug. It is the type of Aavasthika Kaala. It impacts on efficacy of the drug. Drug exhibits different action when administered in different Aushadha Sevana Kaala. According to predominance of Dosha, at the various stages of the disease, same drug can be administered in different Aushadha Kaala to achieve desired effect. e.g. Gud`a Hareetakee given at Abhakta Kaala is useful in Ars`ha and at Praagbhakta Kaala it is useful in Udara Roga.(C. Chi. 13/78) The medicines given at improper time are not useful. Actual aim of Aushadha Sevana Kaala is to provide the fulfillment towards desired action of drug administration in patient in order to produce Dhaatu Saamya. Medicines are of two types i.e. S`hodhana and S`hamana. Aushadha Sevana Kaala is for S`hamana type of treatment. S`hamana Chikitsaa is of Dravyaroopa and Adravyaroopa types. Aushadha Sevana Kaala is for Dravyaroopa Chikitsaa. Synonyms of Aushadha Sevana Kaala: Aushadha Sevana Kaala varies in the names and numbers as per Samhitaa. Aushadha Sevana Kaala according to Charaka, Sus`hruta, Vaagbhat`a are summarized in the following Chart: C.Chi.30/298) ( A.H.Su.13/37) (S.U.64/65) Discussion of Aushadha Sevana Kaala in Samhitaa: In all 11 Kaala are explained. Sus`hruta had explained 10. They are mainly related to food, like before food, after food or without food etc. So these are known as Aavasthika Kaala. Nis`haa Kaala is only additional in Asht`aanga Sangraha, but it is also Aavasthika as Vaagbhat`a in Asht`aanga Hridaya explains it as Svapna Kaala. Charaka added two more Kaala other than above mentioned: Balavaana (Strong) patient should take the medicine in the morning, before consuming any food. Durbala (Weak) patient should consume the medicine with Pathyaahaara S`haarangdhara had adopted a different method for explanation. At sunrise, it includes Ananna. Adhobhakta -Divasabhojane Adhobhakta - Saayambhojane Includes Muhurmuhu and Includes Nis`haa Kaala.  Aushadha Sevana Kaala and Diseases: Description of Aushadha Sevana Kaala: Abhakta Kaala /Ananna Kaala: In the morning, when the previous food is digested but the person is not hungry, drug gets easily distributed all over the body. As stomach is empty, drug remains unmixed with the food and its Veerya remains Anupahata i.e. unimpaired.Such drugs with Anupahata Veerya, cures the diseases quickly. In Baala, Vriddha, Stree and emaciated person precautions should be taken while administering the drug. Abhakta Kaala is in morning, which is Kapha dominating Kaala. The drugs having Tikta and Kat`u Rasa, Teekshn`a Gun`a, Ushn`a Veerya are well tolerated. This Kaala is also known as Rasaayana Kaala. e.g. Braahma Rasaayana (C. Chi. 1-1/41-57) should be given at this Kaala in S`hvaasa. Praagbhakta / Annaadau: In this Kaala, drug is administered just before food, when the person is hungry; the previously consumed food is completely digested. Drug given in this Kaala gets digested quickly. As it is covered by food, it is safe in children, old patients. Drug given in this Kaala is followed by meal. Food covers the drug from upper side. This prevents Urdhva Gati of drug and enhances Adhara Gati. This helps drug to reach at site of Apaana. Though Sthaulya is Kaphaja Naanaatmaja Vikaara(C. Su.21) the Vaata and the Agni are main factors in its pathogenesis and are restricted in the Kosht`ha. Drug administered in Praagbhakta Kaala pacifies the Vaata and Agni is controlled which leads to control Kshudhaa. So medicines for Krishikarn`a are given at this Kaala Madhyabhakta: Madhya means halfway through the meal. In this Kaala drug is administered in between the meal. As drug is given in between the food it is covered by the food. It affects Urdhva as well as Adhara Gati of Drug. Gati of Samaana is also towards Koshtha; which prevents Tiryak Gati of drug. Sushruta has explained it in term of Avisaaribhaavaat. Avisaaribhaava is nature of dispersion. This term shows that the drug given in Samaana Kaala is limited to Kosht`astha organs due to its Avisaaribhaava. Site of Samaana is Grahan`ee. So the drugs given in this Kaala directly comes in contact with Agni and Samaana Vaata. Then it cures the diseases of Agni and Samaana Vaayu. Paachaka Pitta is needed for digestion. Drugs; given in this Kaala act on Paachaka Pitta and increases digestion power. Adhobhakta / Bhojanaante / Bhuktaante : This Kaala comes immediately after the food. Here drugs are administered after food. This prevents Adhara Gati of drug. Drug can spread with Urdhva and Tiryak Gati. Vyaana Kaala is after lunch. In day time, Rasavaha Srotas and its Moolasthaana i.e. heart is in Vikasita Avasthaa. Hence drugs given in this Kaala acts on the heart as well as Vyaana Vaayu. Udaana Kaala is after dinner. When the drugs given at night-after the dinner, act on Udaana Kaala and the diseases due to Udaana Prakopa. Site of Kapha is also at upper part of the body. Hence the drugs given in this Kaala are useful in Kapha Roga. Drugs, which have Brihan`a Karma used for Sthoolikaran`a, are used at this Kaala. Sabhakta: Administration of drugs with the food is called as Sabhakta. Those drugs, which dont have the pleasant taste and odor are mixed with the food and then administered. This Kaala is ideal in the children and the persons who refuse the medicine. The drugs given in this Kaala mixed in Rasa Dhaatu and spreads all over the body in Urdhva, Adhara and Tiryak Gati, therefore useful in those diseases, which are spread all over the body. Antaraabhakta: Antaraabhakta means in between meals. When the process of the digestion of the lunch is completed, drug should be administrated; again after digestion of drug dinner should be consumed. This Kaala is useful in the disease of Vyaana. Saamudga: Drug administered just before meal and immediately after meal. This enables Urdhva as well as Adhara Gati of Drug. Muhurmuhu: It means repeated or frequent administration. This Kaala is advised in S`hvaasa, Kaasa, Hikkaa, Trishn`aa, Chhardee, Visha and Praan`a related diseases. These are the diseases in which Dosha are in Sanchaya and Vegavasthaa is observed. Muhurmuhu drug administration pacifies Dosha and Vegavasthaa can be prevented. Sagraasa: Drugs administered with each Graasa (moracel) of meal. This Kaala is for the diseases of Hridya and Praan`a. Annagrahan`a is the function of Praan`a. Drug administered in this Kaala directly acts on Praan`a and cures diseases of Praan`a. Drugs for Agnideepana and Vaajeekaran`a are administered in this Kaala. Graasaantara: This drug is administered after every Graasa (moracel). It is useful in Praan`a, Vyaana and Udaana Prakopajanya Roga and Heart diseases. Nis`hi: The drug administered just before sleep. This Kaala is useful in the Urdhvajatrugata Roga. Adhara Gati of drug is prevented by food. Drug spreads in Urdhava Gati. Hence cures the diseases of eye, ear, nose, throat, head etc. S`haarangadhara Samhitaa explains this Kaala for Lekhana, Brihan`a, Paachana and S`hamana. In Yonivyaapad Chikitsaa, Charaka has explained the factors which are very important for Chikitsaa. These are Des`ha, Kaala, Pramaan`a etc. (C.Chi.30/296) Aushadha Sevana Kaala are explained on the basis of: Dosha: As Vaata is only Chala, Dosha Aushadha Sevana Kaala, are explained according to Vaata and its subtype and not of Pitta and Kapha. Dosha Sanchaya: Dosha are dominant at different time / stage of day, night, digestion and age. This thing is considered while deciding Aushadha Sevana Kaala e.g. Abhakta Kaala for Kapha Roga Vyaadhi Sthaana and Avayava: When Dosha are accumulated in lower parts of body; medicine should be given before meal. Diseases: Medicines given in specific Kaala can cure the disease or reduce the Bala and frequency of the Roga effectively. e.g. Muhurmuhu for S`hvaasa Vega. In short, Medicines administrated, have three Gati viz. Urdhva, Adhara and Tiryak. Food provides a covering media, which enhances the expected direction of medicines.

It emphasizes the importance of a qualified physician in managing health and disease. Chikitsaa is divided into eight branches, with Kaaya Chikitsaa focusing on systemic and psychosomatic disorders.\n\nThe human body is a harmonious interplay of four basic constituents: Vata, Pitta, Kapha, and Manas (mind). When these constituents are in balance, health prevails. However, external or internal factors can disrupt this equilibrium, leading to disease.\n\nAyurvedic management aims to re-establish this lost balance by employing two main approaches:\n\n1. Shodhana (Purification): This involves eliminating vitiated Doshas (imbalances) from the body through five main procedures: Vamana (induced vomiting), Virechana (induced purging), Basti (medicated enemas), Nasya (nasal instillations), and Raktamokshana (bloodletting).\n\n2. Shamana (Palliation): This approach focuses on converting harmful substances into non-toxic forms without eliminating them from the body. It includes seven types of measures:\n\n   - Paachana: Improving digestion to reduce toxic substances\n   - Deepana: Intensifying digestive fire\n   - Kshut Nirodha: Withholding hunger\n   - Trit'nirodha: Withholding thirst\n   - Vyaayaama: Physical exercise\n   - Aatapa Sevaa: Exposure to sunlight\n   - Marut Sevaa: Exposure to dry, clean air\n\nIn addition to these two main approaches, Ayurveda also incorporates Rasaayana (rejuvenation), Vaajikaran'a (reproductive tissue metabolism), Daivavyapaas'hraya (rituals and offerings), Satvaavajaya (psychological measures), and Yuktivyapaas'hraya (rational management using medicine or surgery).\n\nThe management of any disease involves a team effort between the Vaidya (physician), Dravya (substances used for treatment), Upasthaataa (attendant), and Rogee (patient).

Charaka defines Chikitsaa as all such measures, that when employed, establishes the physician equilibrium of the body constituents and re-establishes health. All this should be done by a competent physician only. This definition is so broad that it includes not only medication but also other non-material methods like meditation, offerings to fire, and the deities, as well as counselling. In the same definition, he has categorically stated that health and disease management is the function of a trained, qualified and competent physician and not of a quack. It is also the chief of the eight branches / specialties of Ayurveda because: - The scope of this branch is described as follows: Kaaya Chikitsaa is that branch of Ayurveda which deals with systemic diseases, Psychosomatic disorders their diagnosis and management both from preventive, promotive and curative aspects till their recurrence is sealed off. Human life is an inseparable confluence of four basic constituents: - Each has certain qualities attributed to it and due to which they fully partake in the life process when they are in a state of harmony. When extrinsic or intrinsic factors come in contact with the internal milieu of the body, they succeed in disturbing its equilibrium and the result is manifested in disease. Depending upon the nature of the intensity of assault, the diseases exhibit a variety of symptomatology. Their base remains twofold viz. body (soma) and the mind (psyche). Though these two have been separately enumerated most of the diseases are psychosomatic in nature. Causative factors have been elaborately classified and described in the texts and by the commentators too. Similarly the management too has been classified into various categories. The main aim is to re-establish the lost balance, restore a state optimum function of all the body life constituents and make it a happy and beneficial one. The management always aims at relieving the person from suffering, in and so the attending physician must assess the condition diligently and accurately. This is known as Nidaana or diagnosing the condition. It is done by two methods positive i.e. by identifying the situation by studying the symptomatology, the cause effect relationship and the pathogenesis in depth; the other method is of elimination of all other possibilities and then to arrive at the final diagnosis or the differential diagnosis. In practice one has to employ both the methods judiciously. (Refer to the article on Nidaana). This understanding gives the physician the complete clinical picture of both the patient and his disease as well as information regards the onset, duration and progression; the strength of the disease and the possible course it would take in case of failure to treat; the possible complications that could arise or signs of fatality, the residual damage that could remain in case of chronic or less severe disease. Planning the management presupposes this understanding. Physical diseases need physical handling. This is mainly of two types: Panchakarma (please refer to Panchakarma article elsewhere) Purificatory measures; this is a set of five procedures that physically eliminate the contaminant, vitiated Dosha_s (please refer to the article on concept of Dosha elsewhere) out of the system. These purificatory measures are as under: - Emesis  Vamana, it is useful for diseases of Kapha and it eliminates the vitiated, disease causing Kapha by medicine induced vomiting Purging  Virechana is useful for diseases of the Pitta and it eliminates the vitiated disease causing Pitta by drug induced purging. Enemata  Basti it is useful in conditions arising out of aggravated Vaata. This helps eliminate and control the vitiated and diseases causing Vaata by retention of liquid enemata. Nasal instillations  Nasya these modalities are useful for Dosha_s harbouring in the supra-clavicular region and which cannot be accessed by the previous methods. Blood-letting  Raktamokshan`a this modality is employed to eliminate the vitiated Dosha_s circulating in the internal environment and which defy attempts of bringing them to the alimentary canal for elimination. This is also used to treat sensory symptoms like parasthesiae. The principle behind purification is to rid the internal environment of various Patho-physiological blocks that have developed between the vitiated Dosha_s and the harbouring body constituents. Thus they re-establish the proper movement of Vaata along its natural pathways. S`hamana Chikitsaa / Palliative measures to not eliminate the contaminants out of the internal environment but they render them in such a form that they do not remain contaminants any more. This is done by improving the Agni function (Agni is the individuals digestive capacity  Refer to Agni article elsewhere). These are of seven types and described below: - Paachana It is aimed at relieving the burden on the weak digestive power, which leads to formation of a transient metabolite, which is a toxic, occluding and non-nourishing substance, called Aama. It is generated in place of Aahaara Rasa because of which it has access to all the sites of Rasa. Since this is a contaminating substance and heavier, grosser, slimier, slower owing to its larger molecule size, it cannot penetrate the cells and the result is occlusion. Thus it exhibits a natural tendency to hamper the normal functioning of the local constituents. Hence the first step in any management, where the purification is not possible, the physician has to try and convert this undigested or partly converted material and free the constituents of its burden. This is effectively done by improving the intensity of the digestive power of the person. The first to come to the rescue is the pungent taste, which is made up of a combination of fire and air. These substances intensify the digestive activity and thus reduce the burden of Aama. The next is the bitter taste. This has a predominance of air and space. This too results in absorbing the extra fluids in the internal milieu and thus reduces the burden on Agni. The next are the salty and sour tastes which too have a fire component in them thus they improve the digestive capacity. The last is the astringent taste, which has the air component in it. These substances reduce the excess fluidity and unctuousness from the internal milieu and render it dry, light thus reducing the Aama. The only taste that is useless for Paachana is sweet. These substances act mainly on the Dhaatvagni_s or the parts of the Jaat haraagni that are situated in the basic seven tissues controlling their metabolism. Deepana : It is aimed at intensifying the gastric fire / Jaat `haragni, it is the main source of conversion of ingested food and water. It is responsible for the generation of Aahaara Rasa and thus reaches the nourishment to all other body constituents. The abnormal function of Agni e.g. hypo function or Mandaagni, hyper function or Teekshn`aagni, or erratic function or Vishamaagni leads to generation of Aama. This results in malnutrition of the tissues and occlusion of the internal spaces. This further leads to various conditions of occluding retentive nature along with Vaata aggravation. In order to set this right the procedure adopted is called Deepana. It is best done by pungent, sour tastes, preparations like Aasava or Arisht`a (dosage form containing self generated alcohol) This intensified Agni then converts the Aama to a non-toxic form and brings it to the alimentary canal for elimination. Ayurveda professes that most of the intrinsic diseases are a result of malfunctioning of Agni. Hence management of Agni is the essence of health management. Kshut Nirodha: It is withholding hunger, fasting or restricted food intake. Today the merits of fasting are being realized by the people and the medical fraternity alike, as a per excellence eradicator of free radicals and antioxidants. If total fasting is difficult to endure then restricted food intake according the condition under treatment is advised. This reduces the burden over the Agni and the amount of circulating Aama. It is a very tool in the management of Santarpana diseases (conditions arising out of plenty of every thing food, drink, rest). The food restriction is specific to disease conditions. It can be used as a promotive and a preventive tool also. It has been incorporated into the daily regiment and people observe fasts generally once a week. However they do not adhere to the diet that is expected during the fast and this results in further Aama generation; the most common example of wrong diet being sago, potatoes, bananas, sweet potato, coconut etc on the day of fast. A fast is to be observed for giving rest to the overworked digestive system so that it has a chance to cope up with accumulated Aama and be ready for the next meal on the following day. Trit`nirodha: Trit`nirodha is withholding thirst or restricting water intake. It is very difficult to restrict water intake completely but in certain conditions like ascitis, Ayurveda advises complete refraining from water and the patient is shifted to cows milk or buttermilk till his condition subsides sufficiently. Other condition where water retention is the cause of disease, excretion of fluids is another condition where it is essential to restrict water intake. The via media suggested for this situation is called as Siddha Jala i.e. medicated water prepared by using various herbs in specified amounts and is administered throughout the day. Depending upon the predominant Dosha it could be boiled or cooled or served hot. It is advised during the rainy season for normal persons due to humidity and overcast skies the digestive capacity is compromised and it definitely leads to Aama generation. To prevent this, observing fast and consuming hot and medicated water is advised. This proves beneficial if followed faithfully. Vyaayaama: Vyaayaama is physical exercise, any physical activity done regularly repeatedly, till half the capacity of the person yields beneficial results. The symptoms of having reached half your capacity are Breathe through mouth Appearance of sweat on the forehead, Axillae, tip of the nose, joints etc. These are indications that a person should stop his exercise at this point; else it could lead to serious consequences. Exercise is a powerful modality for managing diseases of musculoskeletal and neurological origin. It is useful to improve the tone of the postural muscles and muscle power of the voluntary muscle groups; it imparts stability by managing the excess fluid in the tissues and it is crucial in converting the Aama by intensifying the Agni. It should be done under supervision initially and with sharp eye for the signs described earlier. Physiotherapy and occupational therapy are the paramedical branches dealing with rehabilitation and exercise. Aatapa Sevaa: Aatapa Sevaa is exposure to suns rays; it has affinity with Rakta Dhaatu. A word of caution is that exposure to the sun should preferably be in the evening and not in the morning. The intensity of the rising sun increases with every passing moment while it is decreasing in the evening. Persons who are sensitive to the sun should take care or avoid it completely. It has a beneficial effect on blood circulation. Marut Sevaa: Marut Sevaa is exposure to dry, clean wind or clime. In some conditions a change of climate is beneficial for controlling the disease process. Excessive humidity, pollution with high percentage of suspended particulate matter is injurious to the internal milieu. A change of climate helps medication. Some authorities interpret it as practice of Praan`aayaama  the Yogic breathing technique, breath control. This in short was the set of palliative treatments where the vitiated Dosha_s are not expelled but converted by increasing, intensifying the digestive fire activity. This forms the bulk of the practice of a Vaidya. Rasaayana It is the rejuvenation branch of Ayurveda. It means to improve the Rasa substantively, qualitatively and functionally too and to improve its reach to the smallest possible unit the S`hareera Paramaan`u or the individual cell. This rejuvenation is done in various ways. General  Kut`ee Praaves`hika, in this procedure the patient is confined and isolated during the course of the treatment. The selected medicine is administered at sunrise in such a sufficient dose that he can skip a meal. He undergoes Panchakarma before admission; followed by Abhyanga, Udvartana (removing the excess oil from the skin with dry herbal powders) and Snaana (bath) with medicated water followed by a strict diet and regimen. The results are astounding as if the patient is reborn with all the benefits of Rasaayana. Specific to the disease, age season etc.  Vyaadhi Apunarbhava e.g. for obesity use of S`hilaajatu, Triphalaa; for Grahanee (intestinal motility disorders) use of Parpati and fresh Takra / Buttermilk without adding water. For the desired effect etc.  Kaamya Rasaayana use of Bhringaraaja / Eclipta alba for liver disorders. Without elaborate regimen or restrictions Ayurveda advises a Vaataatapika Rasaayana i.e. a small amount of Chyavanapraas`ha at sunrise for a long period during winter without much dietary restrictions and similarly use of Kooshmaan`d`a Rasaayana in summer etc. Vaajikaran`a It deals mainly with the reproductive tissue metabolism as well as the regenerative activity / capacity of the body. In case of sexually active persons the activity though immense pleasure results in depletion of S`hukra. This terminal and the most potent tissue are a result of thirty days efforts and processing of the ingested food by the various Agni types. It is the main contributor to formation of Oja. Excessive indulgence without consideration to Prakriti, Dhaatu Saarataa, Age, Season, dietary content etc. leads to accumulation and aggravation of Vaata of a high order and significant tissue damage that is difficult to replenish. The accumulated Vaata, depletes S`hukra or Oja which makes the condition very difficult to treat or endure. All diseases affect the regenerative activity hence the management is not complete without adding, some S`hukra facilitating agent, like Rasaayana Vaajikaran`a too can be of general purpose that is effective on all the Dhaatu_s or it could be diseases specific or tissue specific. Substances like gold, silver, mercury As`hvagandhaa, Shilaajatu, cows milk and cows ghee etc. can have a multiple role to play in the body. The purpose of this elaborate and logical exercise is to re-establish the deranged balance of Dosha_s and to cleanse the contaminated Dhaatu_s and other constituents, improve and maintain Agni activity at optimum, maintain smooth function of mind, sense organs and thus establish an optimal state of function of all the body constituents and induce a sense of well being. Health is not a mere absence of disease but a positive state, which needs to be maintained. In order to achieve this it is important to have as clear an understanding of the Hetu, Lakshan`a and Sampraapti of the situation under consideration. The nature of the causative factor, the method of its spread and the course it would take if not treated are all important factors. The amount and intensity of vitiated Dosha_s involved in the Sampraapti, also give a guideline to the measures to be adopted. Basic considerations like Santarpan`a, Apatarpan`a are important clues to measures needed to manage the situation. Other modalities of Chikitsaa are as under: Daivavyapaas`hraya: This involves rituals, wearing amulets, oblations to various deities believed to ameliorate the condition. Any disease when scientifically diagnosed treated fails to yield desired relief then the sages advice is to consider the Karma dimension. This particular modality deals with the Karma Vipaaka. Here the logic of elicitable cause and effect is not apparent. Jyotisha, Atharvaveda procedures like wearing amulets, Man`i. chanting of Mantra_s, offering ghee, medicinal herbs etc. to the holy fire to be carried to the deity are some of the measure that fall under this category. Satvaavajaya: This involves psychological measures like counselling and use of antagonistic emotions to counter the effects of the one causing disturbance. All the diseases are psychosomatic in nature but those conditions in which the psychological component is pronounced are classified as Maanasa Vyaadhi_s, they warrant Satvaavajaya Chikitsaa. In these situations the insight is impaired; the relation between the situation and its perception is lost or affected leading to diverse and bizarre responses to a stimulus. Counselling is aimed mainly at moulding the mindset, making the person realize the fact of the matter, his capabilities, strengths and weaknesses etc. teach him relaxation techniques to combat stress, use of Yoga postures, breathing techniques, meditation are all very helpful. The role of medicines is minimal here as all such agents have a tendency of developing dependence on them. It is aimed at instilling self confidence and esteem in the patient by counselling, offering objective analysis of his perceived predicament, helping him find a solution to the same by refraining from succumbing to various desires that have him in the trouble in the first place, help him wherever essential but ensure that he / she does not develop emotional attachment to the physician. Ask him to read relevant literature, scriptures, reported cases etc. Yuktivyapaas`hraya: Means management of the disease by intervention by either medicine or surgery or other modalities like food and regiment to control the condition logically and rationally. Yukti is putting diverse facts together and constructing possible scenario as regards the causation, progress of the disease to the minute and then planning the management. This scheme is Yukti and management based on this is Vyapaas`hraya. The previous four fold management (S`hodhana, S`hamana, Rasaayana and Vaajikaran`a) falls under this heading. Surgery in conditions that warrants it, cauterisation, branding etc. also is a part of this modality. Alteration of diet, changing it from unwholesome to wholesome, regulating the life style is also a part of this modality. Other classification of Chikitsaa is under the following three headings: Antah Parimaarjana: Antah is internal and Parimaarjana is purification of the internal environment hence it is a group of modalities that when used internally manage to establish equilibrium of the vitiated Dosha_s. They improve the Rasa Dhaatu substantially, qualitatively and functionally thereby establishing homeostasis. This has an explicit effect on the Rasa and its circulation and Rasa in turn is dependent on Agni function for its generation, hence these types of modalities act on Agni full tilt (it is the purifier par excellence in the universe.) Bahih Parimaarjana Bahih Means external and Parimaarjana is cleansing, purification, thus all such external measures using the skin as e.g. the Abhyanga (massage), Lepa (anointing), Parisheka (sprinkling of medicated oil or liquids on the affected part), Avagaaha (immersion bath involving the affected part or general), Unmardana (kneading the affected part) etc. result in pacifying the external manifestations on the skin or external symptoms of internally vitiated Dosha_s fall under this category. S`hastra Pran`idhaana: Is surgical intervention, it is of eight types, various incisions to cut, puncture, cleanse debride, explore, manipulate, extract, reduce and set fractures and finally suture, applying leeches, chemical cautery etc. are the modalities of this particular branch. Chikitsaa Paada Chatusht`aya: Management of any disease is a team effort and Ayurveda describes the team as having the following four participants: - Vaidya - the first and the most important member of the team, if he is competent then the patient has a chance to recover. The sages have described the basic minimum attributes that a physician should possess to be successful they are as under: Daaksha  attentiveness, alertness about the patients condition, Teerthaattas`haastraartha  one who has learned the science from an adept; according to the method prescribed; to his teachers satisfaction and after he grants his permission as well as the royal permission to commence the profession of healing. Drisht`akarmaa  one who has had adequate practical experience of his craft under the able guidance of his teacher and finally S`huchi  one who understands the importance of purity and cleanliness in his thought, word and practice Dravya  the substances with which the physician tries to manage a disease should also possess the following four attributes Bahu Kalpa  it should have the possibility of variety of dosage forms, it should be possible to use it in innovative form and processes, Bahu Gun`a  it should have a wide range of attributes in it, Sampanna  it should be possessed of proper inherent qualities like colour, time of picking, harvesting, properly stored, devoid of impurities etc. and finally Yogya  will produce the therapeutic clinical effect after administration to the patient. Upasthaataa  is the attendant, nursing care provider in the management of the patient. He / she should also possess the following four qualities: Anurakta attached to the patient, one who has the well being of his charge at the centre of his thoughts and is compassionate S`huchi clean himself and diligent about the cleanliness of his charge and the environment, Daksha alert to the condition of his charge and Buddhimaana intelligent, prompt in responding to the need of his charge Rogee is the patient; he also should possess the following four qualities: Aad`hya very well to do to downright rich, this is important for providing specialized health care, building a cottage for Rasaayana, and for delivery etc. Bhishak Vas`hya should willingly submit himself to the control of his physician, should have faith in him and be ready to comply with his instructions, Dnyaapaka should be capable of lucidly describing his situation to the attending physician and Satvavaana should possess strong will to overcome the disease and become healthy; should be ready for whatever may be the treatment modality adopted faithfully. Dietary restrictions imposed upon him by the attending physician  About the efficacy of the medicine The administered medicine should exhibit its action on the condition for which it was administered without generating any untoward effect. The specialty of Ayurvedic management is that it is holistic in every sense of word. It has due consideration to all the aspects of the disease and the diseased person. The consideration Apunarbhava or ensuring non-recurrence of the disease, disease specific rejuvenation is some of the aspects worthy of special notice. Vaidya Vilas Nanal Sr. Scientist AyuSoft.

Bhagandara Introduction: Bhagandara is anal fistula. Generally, while treating Bhagandara, principles to treat Vran`a should also be applied. Chikitsaa Prior to manifestation of Bhagandara, Bhagandari Pit`ikaa appears. It is necessary to avoid suppuration in the Pit`ikaa. For this purpose, Rakta Sraava and Seka could be done. Then also, if the Pit`ikaa gets suppurated, then Snehana, Svedana, Avagaaha Sveda should be done. Bhagandara should be treated with following modalities: Virechana Eshan`a (to know the direction of the Bhagandara tract using probe) Paat`ana When Bhagandara becomes clean (free from vitiated Dosha) with above four Chikitsaa Karma, it is to be burnt / cauterized by using oil i.e. Taila Daaha Ks`haarasootra should be used in Bhagandara management. When the tract of Bhagandara is split open with the Kshaara, it should be treated like a Vran`a. If Bhaagandaree Pid`akaa is Apakva (not perforated and without suppuration), then it is to be treated with the procedures in following order Apatarpan`a Aalepa Parisheka Abhyanga Sveda Vimlaapana Upanaaha Paachana Visraavan`a Snehana Vamana Virechana S`hataponaka Chikitsaa If Bhaagandaree Pid`akaa is Pakva i. e. spontaneously perforated and with suppuration, it should be treated in the following manner Snehana Avagaaha Sveda Bhagandara should be examined with the procedure same as that of Ars`ha Bhagandara may be having opening internally or externally. Using probe (Eshan`aa), its direction should be defined and in that direction, incision to be made. This is to be done for both the types of Bhagandara having opening internally or externally. After that, Agni Karma or Ks`haara Karma is to be done. This is the general treatment for all the types of Bhagandara. If the Bhagandara tract is incised more than once it may lead to widening the anus and even urine and stools may pass through it. Repeated incisions vitiate Vaayu which causes Guda S`hoola (pain in ano rectal region), Aat`opa (gurgling in the abdomen). Hence it is advisable to avoid repeated surgery. If anal perforation or laceration occurs, it may lead to death. (Guda is a Praan`aayatana and Sadyah Praan`ahara Marma) In S`hataponaka, the incision should be Ardhalaangalaka plough like Laangalaka Sarvatobhadra - military array Goteerthaka it suggests flexibility of the incision. Multiple and flowing incisions can be taken, It resembles the external genitalia of a cow / oblong or it could resemble the pug marks of a cow at their drinking place. After that, Agnikarma / cauterization should be done. S`hataponaka is difficult to cure in Sukumaara and Bheeru persons. After the S`hastrakarma, following is the advised regime Svedana By using Kris`haraa, Paayasa, made from Graamya, Aanoopa, Audaka, Vishkira Maamsa; Kvaatha of Vrikshaadanee, Eran`d`a, Bilva should be used for Naad`ee Sveda.

To protect the sense organs to be efficient as the phase growth takes place, skin, eyes, ears, nose, and tongue need some specific methods of protection. The integrity of the skin provides protection to all the tissues inside. The skin however is exposed to the wrath of heat, cold, damp, or dry variations in the climate. Due to these, the integrity of the skin is at risk. This may lead to a minor breach of the covering layer, which allows the fluids, blood cells, or even thicker materials to be emitted. This applies even to the inside skin of all sense organs. The adverse factors stated above come in contact, and disturb the integrity. There is a very simple example of the season of severe cold. The usual oily sweat does not cover the skin, and when one smears the skin with any suitable oil / fat, the feared disintegration of the skin is avoided. Nature provides an abundant fatty layer below the skin to animals in polar climate, whereas it is not so with the equatorial animals. The skin smeared with oil can tolerate impacts better than the dry skin. Ayurvedic scientists have rightly advocated the application of oil to increase the resistance, and to support tissue building in situations where it is necessary. The delivery of a baby, or untimely abortion, can cause a wound inside. To compensate this tissue loss, nutritive food with proper stimulation of digesting capacity, is definitely useful. The every day application of oil massage supports the framework by forming a protective layer on the entire skin, which is a barrier between the external stimuli and skin. The oily layer engulfs fine particles coming in contact with it, and nullifies or diminishes their attacking potency. It is so for microbes too. The ear is exposed to dry air, fine dust, extra warmth or too hot environment in some seasons. Suitable cotton / woolen covering protects it from the wrath of severe cold too. Nature provides a little waxy secretion to the external part of the ear to protect the skin. With exposures to dust there is risk of a layer formation, which if not attended in time can lead to obstructive pathology. Sesame oil warmed enough in a continuously burning wick lit lamp is a useful protective instillation. A clean index finger dipped up to two small joints can drop suitable instillation volume in a single external ear by holding it over the ear, and waiting for a while till the oil drips down. The warm oil if taken from a warm source, should be checked for the temperature not being too hot. The comfortable warm oil dropped by the above method should be allowed to act for a while. In a dry ear it makes the inside of ear oleated. Later on the bud (prepared by whirling clean soft cotton cloth) is inserted and is useful for removing the softened layer of dirt. Children may have a tendency to have more sticky material, whereas elderly persons have more dryness. Both can be managed by adjusting the span between two instillations. The skin is a sense organ, which is dry when compared with the tissues inside the body. Nature is providing sweat secretion to create a smear of oily matter. The massage of skin by suitable oil is useful to increase the integrity of the skin, which is otherwise prone to cracking. Ayurvedic advice is for long contact of warm and medicated oils/fats to external skin and to internal organs, due to the specific property of separating the excretory waste material stuck to the useful tissues. An iron nail when rusted can be rendered clean by abrasives, where the strength of iron is lost. But if it is repeatedly mopped by oils, the rust gets separated from the nail without losing the iron-strength. The capacity to ward away the wastes without risk of losing the metal is taken advantage of in applications and administrations of oils/fats. The medicated status facilitates comes out (re-excretion) of the fat along-with other waste products not wanted by the body. The oils are especially protective to vegetarian food eaters as their foods contain legumes that need oils. Animal food eaters lack no such component dominant in their food. There are distinct results of Ayurvedic treatment in case of failure by other treatments. The Panchakarma specialty banks significantly on oils. So the massage of skin and contact at all outlets is health promoting by the rationale stated earlier. Regular, long-term application protects one from geriatric changes, and ensures natural sleep without harmful stimuli, and thereby harvests additional benefits. It controls pain and enhances the capacity of the sense organs. It helps augmentation of tissues, and therefore is beneficial to growing babies and recovering mothers, elderly persons needing support to strengthen tissues. Eyes are provided with lids that protect the eyes from entry of dust, extra bright light, or shower. There is a thin film of lachrymal secretion for free gliding. A small film of very mild secretion promoting substance, applied inside the lower lid can give continuous stimulus. The eyes are rich in shining and the dominance of covering substances should therefore be avoided. This is more appropriate in childhood. The black soot from the flame of a wick, using fuel from clarified (cows ghee) butter and camphor is collected on water cooled silver, copper or bronze plates base. Stainless steel or aluminum is not to be used. This black soot is carefully thoroughly homogenized, for a dry type use. Even the ghee, camphor, castor oil fuelled wick is burnt to black, instead of ash. The black burnt wick is homogenized carefully using 7, 8 drops of castor oil. This is also useful for application as above. Certain herb powders (of Anethum sowa, Embelia ribes, Cinnamomum camphora) are spread over castor oil / ghee smeared on a thin cotton cloth. The cloth is rolled into a wick. This wick is lighted in usual ghee fuelled lamp. The black soot is collected as described earlier. When the oily type is to be used; by clean fingers, this soot is thoroughly homogenized with pure castor oil or ghee. The black admix is carefully preserved in clean shallow container, with a proper clean lid. The dry type is more appropriate for a child up to 3 months. Every day for 4 to 5 times the thin smear of this well protected black admix, termed Kaajala is applied on the inside of the lower eyelid, of the child, by clean index finger tip of the mother or governess. In the eyes of child at the time of oil massage, preparatory for a bath, a drop of clean warm oil should be instilled. This facilitates smoother cleansing if some material is stuck in the eye. Allowing a span of a few minutes immersion of eye in warm medicated fat by proper positioning is another protective procedure termed Netrabasti. This is claimed to possess efficacy to correct some refractive errors common in childhood. Application of oil on outer skin of both feet is a useful protective measure for safeguarding eyes, with the potential risk of exposure to fatigue, that too in a hot environment. It is also very beneficial for weak or old people. The tongue is exposed to a number of stimuli, at times hot, cold, desiccant dry etc. Frequent gargles of lukewarm water are protective and keep the taste sense organ sensitive to fine differences in tastes. There should not be any chance for a thick layer to accumulate on it by astringent, bitter tasting herbal material. In children this care is to be taken by elders till the child understands the significance of the required routine. The nose is a cone like structure aptly compared to a conch. Care is therefore needed to maintain free passage where potentially there are chances of occlusion. To avoid drying in the area deep inside instillation of oil drops that have more fineness than other oils is practiced. Instillation of saline drops (warm) helps initially, but stronger irritant stimuli may require, in cold seasons. To grown children and adult onwards, smear of clarified butter from broader the end of cone to its highest reachable point, is very beneficial. It separates the otherwise prone to stick material smoothly. Instillation of various materials including medicated smokes through nose is useful in a number of ways to improve upon the sensitivity of all sense organs including the tongue too. Certain yogic breathing techniques after proper learning are helpful for the care of smell-organ and variety of sinusitis. Application/massage of oils to head is helpful to take care of all sense organs.

Vaataja Pittaja Kaphaja Tridoshaja Dvisht`aarthajaa (Bheebhtsajaa) Dauhridajaa  due to insult of likings of pregnant woman Aamajaa  in diseases like Visoochikaa Saatmyaprakopajaa (Saatmya Tyaagaat)  suddenly giving up the Saatmya. Krimijaa  due to worms Saamanya Chikitsaa All types of Chaardi have the same cause, the irritation of Aamaas`haya. As it Aas`haya of Aama, its irritation is treated by treating Aama. Langhana (Fasting with light food or without food) is the best remedy for treating Aama. Also regime like Saatmya Annapaana, S`huska Phala Sevana, and Application of aromatic powders, follow by bath should be given. In addition, mouth should be washed with cold water. Aavasthika Chikitsaa S`hodhanaarha Rugn`a: If the person suffering from Chhardi is Balavaan (having capacity / strength to tolerate effects of disease as well as treatment), should be treated by Kapha - Pittaghna S`hodhana i.e. Vamana and Virechana. Vaata gets aggravated by Vamana or Virechana hence in Vaataja Chhardi both the procedures should be avoided. S`hamanaarha Rugn`a: Durbala (weak) patient should be treated by S`hamana and Langhana. Drugs and diet should have following properties: Manodnya (liked / favorite) Laghu (easy to digest) Saatmya (wholesome / habitual) Vis`hushka (Dry) Sugandhi (flavored / aromatic) After having food sprinkling of cold water on face is also suggested. These all things are advised for pacification of Dosha and Chhardi increasing the strength. Laajaa is the best S`hamana Dravya for Chhardi. Vaataja Chhardi: Contraindicated treatment: S`hodhana is contraindicated in Vaataja Chhardi, if administered likely complications are chest pain or Hridaya Drava etc. Hence, only S`hamana is the choice to treat. Ghrita is the drug of choice in this condition. It is used with Saindhava (rock salt) or medicated Ghrita are used. Indicated treatment: Sneha Virechana (Virechana by unctuous medicines or medicines along with ghee or oils like Eran`d`a Taila) is also advised by Sus`hruta Samhitaa. Ghrita added with Kat`u and Lavan`a Dravya is indicated for drink so as to pacify Vaata Dosha. Kashaaya indicated in Vaataja Jvara should be used to treat Vaataja Chhardi. Pittaja Chhardi: Pittaja Chhardi should be treated by Virechana as it is best S`hodhana therapy of Pitta. Pratimaarga (in opposite direction) S`hodhana helps in Vaataanulomana and ultimately pacification of Chhardi. Mridu Virechaka Dravya like Draakshaa, Ikshurasa, Tilvaka Ghrita should be used. If Pitta is more aggravated in Kapha Sthaana, it should be alleviated by Vamana because it is the nearest way of letting Dosha out from Kaphaas`haya. For this Madhura (sweet) and Tikta (Bitter) medicines are used. Kaphaja Chhardi: For Kaphaja Chhardi, Vamana is the treatment of choice as it is the best S`hodhana therapy for Kapha Dosha. If the person suffering from Chhardi is weak, he is treated by S`hamana Kalpa, which is supported by Kaphaghna and Hridya Aahaara. Tridoshaja Chhardi: Tridoshaja Chhardi is treated by combinations of the medicines used in Vaataja, Pittaja and Kaphaja Chhardi respectively after carefully assessing the Dosha dominance, season in which the disease has occurred, Rogabala (intensity / state of disease - Saadhya / Asaadhya) and Agnibala etc. As other Saannipaatika diseases Chhardi too exhibits bizarre signs and symptoms hence the physician has to be innovative it its management. All possible permutations and combinations of medicines, procedures etc. have to be employed depending upon the apparent Dosha dominance along with due consideration to the season of onset, physical power of the person and his digestive capacity as well as the strength of the diseases with its prognosis. Dvisht`aarthajaa Chhardi: This type of Chhardi is also called as Manobhighaataja Chhardi. The first step of treatment is to avoid / refrain from the causative factors. This is supported by indulgence in favourite food, fragrance of flowers, soil (wet soil), sour fruits etc. Aas`hvaasana and Harshan`a (counseling) are also equally important to divert the persons attention from the cause. Sus`hruta Samhitaa advocates treatment for specific type: Aamaja Chhardi  Langhana, Vamana Asaatmyaja Chhardi Saatmya Aahaara, Vihaara Bibhatsaja Chhardi  Hridya Aahaara, Vihaara Dauhrid Avamaanaja Chhardi  completing the demand Krimija Chhardi  Treat as per Krimija Hridroga Saatmya: Charaka Samhitaa specifies it as the route of causative factor is the best way of using medicine for the disease e. g. if Chhardi is caused by Asaatmya Gandha it should be treated by Saatmya Gandha. Saatmya is homologous stimulus response; some substances are homologous from birth due to the Prakriti while others become homologous by repeated consumption / habit forming. Sudden deviation from usual, homologous behaviour is a cause for diseases like Chhardi. Hence the principle of management is to restore the homologation that is disturbed and allay the condition. The various ways it could be done are described above. Prasakta Chhardi (chronic / persistent vomiting): Excessive Chhardi causes Dhaatukshaya (dehydration, loss of fluid content first and finally the unctuous content too, resulting in depletion of the volume of Dhaatu), resulting in Vaata Prakopa which creates further complications. Stambhana and Brimhan`a treatment advised in Vamana Karma Atiyoga should be given in this condition. Sarpigud`a, Maamsarasa, Ghrita (Medicated as Kalyaan`aka, Tryooshan`a, Jeevaneeya) as well as Pathya Leha are also used to treat Prasakta Chhardi Gun`a / Karma - Laghu, S`hushka, Saatmya Dhaanya - Bharjita Yava, Jeern`a Shasht`ika S`haalee, Godhuma, Bharjita Godhuma, Tand`ula S`himbee - Sateena, Maasha, Bharjita Mudga, Chan`aka Maamsa - S`has`ha, Mayoora, Tittira, Laavaa, Jaangala Maamsa, S`hushka Maamsa Phala - Naarikela, Nimbuka, Aamalakee, Badara, Draakshaa, Kapittha, Haritakee, Daad`ima, Maatulunga, Aamara, Mridvikaa Kritaanna - Laajaa Mand`a, Yoosha, Raaga, Khaand`ava, Paanaka, Avaleha, Khad`a Apathya: Gun`a/ Karma - Snigdha, Ushn`a, Vidaahee, Drava S`haaka - Alaaboo, Bimbee, Kaaravellaka, Chitraka, Meda, Sarshapa Search Anveshaka: Search for Dravya, Kalpa, Aahaara, Chikitsaa Karma, Vihaara Vyaadhi Chhardi Adhikaara  Chhardi Karma  Chhardinigrahn`a, Vamana, Virechana for S`hodhana, Stambhana, Brimhan`eeya, Hridya.

In addition to the patients pathetic suffering, the sight of the patient writhing or agitating in a fit of convulsion is itself very painful to the healthy persons. Mind and Buddhi are not easily approachable either for investigation or treatment. Hence disease reappears with other difficulties both for the patient and his family. The disease as such requires a rational approach both for the diagnosis and treatment. APASMAARA-APA S`HABDO GAMANAARTHAM Going away SMARAH ---- SMARAN`AM Memory, knowledge of the surrounding, of the past events. Apasmaara is a disease in which memory (Smriti), intellect (Buddhi) and mind (Sattva) get flowed out all together and there are disgusting movements by the patient. This is a momentary phase (Aavasthika) in which the patient gropes in the dark (Tamah Praves`ha). This causes results from loss of DHI i.e. understanding or wisdom, Sattva (Consciousness when the mind gets deranged .. worry (CHINTAA), grief (S`HOKA), fears (BHAYA) etc. It happens because of the vitiated Dosha. When the mind gets deranged by the obstruction of the SANDNYAAVAHA channels (loss of consciousness) the person enters darkness with his mind becoming inactive, performs terrifying actions such as grinding the teeth, frothing at mouth, shaking the hands and feet violently (convulsion) seeing non-existing things, loses balance and falls to the ground, with irregular eye movements, gets up regaining conscious after the expiry of bouts of Dosha. From above definition it can easily understood that the seats of the disease are the Buddhi and Manas including Manovaha channel and the main cause in their deranged functions both in the sensory and motor aspects. Apasmaara is a disease with the deprivation of SMRITI or memory. According to Sus`hruta, Smriti is the faculty of recalling the past sense perceptions / experience. The sense perceptions constitute the knowledge. Therefore one can come to conclusion of Smriti is the experience associated with knowledge. Prodromal Symptoms: The features of the impending disease are tremors and feeling of emptiness of the heart, dizziness, seeing darkness before eyes, worry, abnormal movements of the eyes, sweating, flowing of saliva and nasal secretion, indigestion, loss of appetite, fainting, loss of strength, loss of sleep, body ache, thirst, dreaming of singing etc. Pathogenesis: Dooshya: Mind situated at Mastishka Adhisht`haana: Hridaya & Manovaha channel Srotas (Channel): Manovaha Manas is also considered as Indriya and its objects is Chintya or the subject of thought which is independent of the sense organs. Therefore, can get vitiated due to the Ayoga Heenayoga, Atiyoga or Mithyaayoga contact of mind with Chintaa. Periodicity of the Attack: The vitiated and provoked tremors precipitate an attack of Apasmaara once every twelve days or every fortnight or every month; depending upon the Doshaanubandha, the paroxysm lasting for a brief period. In other words we can say that Vaataja, Pittaja, Kaphaja Apasmaara are accordingly. This periodicity is considered the nature of the disease. Types of Apasmaara: Symptoms Vaataja Apasmaara:(During attack) 10. Grinds teeth 11. Places arms and legs here and there irregularly 12. Fingers are bent inward. 13. Bluish red colour in the eyes, nails, face, skin Pittaja Apasmaara:(During attack) Kaphaja Apasmaara: (During attack) Saannipaatika Apasmaara: Due to all Dosha, all the features appearing together as it is incurable hence no treatment is advised. Prognosis: It is stated by ancient Grantha that for Saannipaatika Apasmaara is incurable. In addition Charakaachaarya states the one which occurs in debilitated persons and which is of long standing are also incurable. Status Epilapticus is also incurable. Treatment of Apasmaara: In Apasmaara the channels of Dhi, Chitta and Mind which have become obstructed are covered by the Dooshya should be cleaned by Panchakarma. The treatment is defined in two states, Treatment during attack period: Since the treatment is the restoration of the activity of Buddhi and it is achieved by the Sams`hodhana treatment, the important purificatory measure of the Panchakarma to be administered during the attack period is Nasyakarma. The arrhythmic activity of the brain is mainly due to the abnormal stimulation. The activity can only be overcome by a strong a counter stimulation of the brain. The nearest route to the brain is nasal canal so Nasyakarma is most important in attack state. Special Instruction External treatment: 1. Nasya: Vachaa (Acorus calamus) Pradhamana Nasya at the time of attack 2. Abhyanga: Jat`aamaamsee (Nardostachys jatamamsi) and Vachaa (Acorus calamus) medicated seasum oil 3.

The story of king Yayaati is a well-known example of it. Youth is the most beautiful stage of life. This is the stage when the tissues are fully developed and obtain the optimum quality. Any being in his youth is full of strength. The Atharva Veda has described that beautiful body and face, good strength and strong built like Vajra are the criteria of an excellent physique. All of these are present only during the phase of youth. This is the most creative stage of life. Hence treatment and research to overcome ageing had always remained the subject on interest. The evolution of longevity therapy can be traced back to Vaidika era. Innumerable references related to desire and treatment for longevity is available in that Veda. Gopatha Braahman`a has described a plant name Soma, which was used to attain strength and longevity. Some more references related to the medicinal properties of Soma are available in 144 th sutra of ninth Mand`ala of Rigveda. Atharvaveda has described few more plants namely Jeevaalaa, Naagharisha, Jeevanti, Traayamaan`a, Sahamaana, and Sarasvati for the purpose of longevity. (Ath. 8/2/6) With this background it wont be a surprise if Ayurveda, the mainstream medical system of that time pays more attention to longevity. In the Charaka Samhitaa, one of the main compendia of Ayurveda, the first chapter is named Deerghanjeeviteeya I.e. about the craving for a long healthy life. By the time of Charaka the science of longevity had advanced to a great extent. The efforts to achieve good tissues, for longevity, is collectively called as Rasaayana Chikitsaa. The Rasaayana therapy gained importance to such an extent, that it became an integral part of Ayurveda, a division in the eight specialized branches. What is Rasaayana? The word Rasaayana has two components, the Rasa that indicates all the nutrient fluid tissue & Ayana means to achieve through its activities the best quality of all the body tissues is Rasaayana. The Rasaayana therapy can be given to healthy individuals for promotion of health, by improved tissues; as well as to the sick, to cure the disease, by better resistance. The Rasaayana therapy retards the process of ageing and hence is used effectively in the chronic diseases due to degeneration and diseases of ageing. To ensure better results, by this therapy, the person to be treated is first subjected to various body purification methods; the Rasaayana Formulations are administered after proper body purification. There are many types of Rasaayana therapy and innumerable drug formulations designed, according to the need of the situation. Usually the desired age group is from the young stage to the first stage of old age. However, it can be administered to person of any age and gender with the physicians discretion. Importance of Rasaayana therapy: Frequent use of an unwholesome diet and wrong dietary habits, exposure to seasonal variations, environmental factors like pollution of water, air, soil, entry of toxic substances via vegetables or other food items, stress and many other factors have a negative impact on our body, resulting in some negative-disease prone-changes. These negative changes are subtle and are a micro level. Accumulation of these changes is continuously happening in our body, over a period of time; and they are responsible for the diseases like Osteo-arthritis, diabetes, or even cancer and also for early ageing. Modern medical science has till today, nothing to offer for eliminating or averting, or preventing these changes, or the diseases as well as ageing. On the other hand to the increasing population of elderly people, the health problems of old age are on the rise. The Rasaayana therapy as mentioned earlier serves both the purposes of promotion of health and longevity as well as to cure the diseases by optimizing the host defense mechanism. The advancement in understanding the cell biology has enabled us to assess the effects of Rasaayana therapy at the cellular level. It has been observed that popularly used Rasaayana stimuli in the forms of herbs like S`hataavaree and As`hvagandhaa have Cytoprotective activity. As`hvagandhaa and Gud`oochi have shown Immunomodulatory effect. Another popular Rasaayana drug Shilaajita has shown Adaptogenic activity. The Rasaayana therapy may revolutionize the approach towards management of lifestyle diseases and ageing in future. Effects of Rasaayana therapy: Classification of Rasaayana methods: The types are 1. Kaamya Rasaayana 2. Naimittika Rasaayana 3. Aajasrika Rasaayana. In this, Rasaayana drugs are administered orally or in the form of Basti. Kaamya Rasaayana: This incorporates various types of Rasaayana methods derived with the intention of optimizing all types of tissues in our body and providing them with stability. In this method some special drugs as well as some dietary items are suggested. The medicinal plants described under Jeevaneeya Gan`a and Vayasthaapana Gan`a by Charaka come under Kaamya Rasaayana. It has been reclassified under many sub classes like: - Naimittika Rasaayana: Naimittika means occasional. The Rasaayana treatment under this category is used to treat specific diseases conditions. Weakness of a system or a type of tissue makes the person vulnerable to specific types of diseases e.g. weakness in Praan`avana Srotas may lead to repeated attacks of respiratory infections and person may become susceptible to pulmonary tuberculosis. The Rasaayana drugs under this class improve the host defense mechanism and strengthen the system thereby preventing the recurrence of the disease. Aajasrika Rasaayana: This method advocates intake of a balanced diet as part of Rasaayana therapy. This includes proper use of dietary factors like milk, honey, ghee etc. Regular use of these dietary items and proper dietary habits helps to maintain the balance amongst the tissues, methods like a cow is fed on a special diet to get a special quality of milk are also described under this class. Physiologically Vaata Dosha becomes dominant in body with advancing age. Vaata is responsible for the process of degeneration and ageing. Basti being the therapy of choice for treatment of Vaata, Rasaayana drugs are also administered in the form of Basti. This therapy is called as Rasaayana Basti. Various types of Yaapana Basti are used as Rasaayana Basti to treat various degenerative disorders. Aachaara Rasaayana: This is the behavioral method adopted regularly in day-to-day life to lead an ideal ethical way of living. The best results of any Rasaayana therapy can be achieved only when the Aachaara Rasaayana is followed during treatment. Aachaara Rasaayana advocates good conduct in personal life as well as in social life. The pious way to lead life, being truthful using soft language, no harsh words, maintaining mental balance, (Saatvika) self-controlled intake of food, love towards every being etc. Regulating the self in many aspects, Yama, Niyama stages of Yoga are also examples of Aachaara Rasaayana, the rejuvenation by behavior. This keeps the mind cool and reduces the stress that is also a major cause of many diseases and of ageing. Vaajeekaran`a: Having achieved better tissues with preparatory purification procedures, self-attentive control, valuable medicinal stimuli; it is expected to harvest benefits for the next generation. To promote the elective chance of conception when the tissues are of best capacity, medication for that is suggested. The Rasaayana improved tissues, when safely promoted to achieve conception by a couple; both enhancement of sexual pleasure and later progeny protection are possible. For the average health, eager individual / couple this is the most desired benefit out of the earlier efforts of Rasaayana. This is done after improvement of tissues, by Vaajeekaran`a stimulus. In total text, the emphasis is on the qualities in a child, so that health promotion can be extended to the next generation. Being capable in performance with desire is the instinct behind sexual union. So the scientific advice for achieving the same by specific food enrichment, by certain herbal and biological substances, is elaborated in Vaajeekaran`a branch. The summary positive health promoting advice, of all compendia, state in one voice that excess indulgence in sex is to be avoided by the health conscious. Those they by self-control, restrict the sexuality; live a long and healthy life. Even in plays and entertainment, one should never forget the scrutiny about beneficial effect or otherwise of every undertaking. Sus`hruta Chi. Ch. 24.at stanzas 111; 112; and 121 categorically express this. The total guidance for health-achieving efforts is summarized after elaboration in earlier chapter. The individual, by his own will should protect himself from the temptation of unlimited sexual union. This is so advised, as the experience is that self-controlling persons age slowly. Sexuality is one of the three legs of the tripod supporting life- (health). It is the basic instinct given by nature to every living being. Healthy sexuality is an extremely important part of a happy and healthy mind and body. Many compendia were written on this subject. The types of men and women according to their physical structure and psychological behavior, a good match to conjugal bliss, methods of romance and conjugation etc. have been elaborated in these compendia. Kamasootra Ananga Ranga, Panchasaayaka are some more popular treatises on the science of sexuality. In ancient times, contrary to todays situation religion and science propagated to have a large number of children. Charaka attributes the significance of sex towards three human obligations for the species. They are obligations to parents and ancestors, to Rishis and to God. Today WHO defines sexual health as the integration of somatic, emotional, intellectual and social aspect of sexual well being, in ways that are positively enriching and that enhance personality, communication and love This definition perfectly matches with the Ayurvedic view behind sexuality. Horse i.e. (Vaajee in Sanskrit) is the symbol of vigor and virility in Hindu tradition. Hence the treatment that makes one like a horse in terms of virility is called as Vaajeekaran`a. This is a type of Kaamya Rasaayana. Vajeekaran`a is used to improve the quality and quantity of S`hukra Dhaatu, the tissue responsible for reproduction and to increase the libido. Many dietary preparations, medicinal, herbal and Herbo-mineral compounds and Basti preparations are mentioned for the Vaajeekaran`a therapy that is being used today successfully. Besides the conjugal bliss and progeny, the S`hukra Dhaatu that is the target of Vaajeekaran`a therapy is also responsible for the regeneration in the tissues. The healthy S`hukra Dhaatu recuperates the degeneration due to daily wear and tear Oja the purest extract processed out of S`hukra is the most vital factor for promotion of physical and mental health and immunity. S`hukra is also responsible for mental factors like enthusiasm, happiness and elation that counteracts with depression and stress. Hence Vaajeekaran`a therapy is also used in psychosomatic disorders. Samkalpa i.e. desire or positive thought is the most important factoring Vaajeekaran`a, Charaka says, this highlights the importance of healthy mind in attaining longevity. Whether ageing has a genetic origin is a million dollar question. However Ayurveda has considered factors like race, mother, father while describing the types of Prakriti that are responsible for the quality of tissues. The Vaajeekaran`a drugs are advised for improving the quality of S`hukra in parents to overcome the Beeja (seed defect) Dosha i.e. the genetic defect. These references may prove useful in the research on the use of Vaajeekaran`a for longevity. Dr.Manoj Nesari. Sr. Scientist AyuSoft.

Examination of Pureesha: It is very important to examine the Pureesha whether it is Aama or Pakva. This examination helps physician to select proper treatment option. Pakva Pureesha: (perfectly processed) Floats on the water whereas, Aama Pureesha: Sinks down to the bottom of water due to its Guru nature. Saamaanya Chikitsaa: Langhana Paachana. Agnideepana Dosha specific treatment Vis`hesha Chikitsaa:  Vaataja Grahan`ee: Pittaja Grahan`ee: Pitta aggravated at its own site, and obliterating Agni should be removed out of the body with the help of Virechana or Vamana. Kaphaja Grahan`ee: Grahan`ee vitiating Kapha should be eliminated by Vamana. By using Ks`haara, Kat`u, Amla and Lavan`a, Tikta Rasa, Agni has to be increased. Procedures advised in Grahan`ee Chikitsaa: Snehana Svedana S`hodhana (Virechana and Vamana.) Langhana  Formulations advised in Grahan`ee Chikitsaa Treatment of Grahan`ee according to Sus`hruta: (Su. U. 40/77 - 182) As per the dominance of the Dosha, the disease should be treated. Paachaneeya, Deepaneeya, Sangrahan`eeya Gan`a are to be administered early in the morning with Suraa / Arisht`a / Sneha / Mootra / Ushn`aambu / Takra Everything that is Deepana should be used in Grahan`ee. Grahan`ee is to be treated avoiding any contrast to the treatment of other concurrent diseases. Treatment of Krimi, Gulma, Udara and Ars`ha is also to be adopted in this disease named Grahan`ee. Diet in Grahan`ee: Diet should have Laghu, Deepaneeya, Ushn`a properties. Peyaa is advised to be used which is made up of Deepaneeya Aushadha. If food is taken after complete digestion of previously taken food, and if taken in amount which can be digested easily, then it leads to perfect balance of Dhaatu. This increases life and health. Otherwise, it leads to the imbalance of Dhaatu. Role of Snehana in Grahan`ee: Sneha is the best entity to enhance activity of Agni. Very heavy diet also is unable to suppress the digestive activity of Agni, which is enhanced by Sneha. Any diet howsoever heavy is unable to suppress Agni that is kindled by Sneha Therefore, it is necessary to administer Sneha in Grahan`ee. Therefore Sneha enjoys a place of eminence in the management of Grahan`ee. Role of Takra (Buttermilk) in Grahan`ee: Takra is useful in diseases due to depletion of Agni as Grahan`ee, Ars`ha, Udara. Takraarisht`a is also useful in this disease. Due to following properties it is indicated in Grahan`ee. Graahee (arrests excessive motions by absorbing the excessive fluid) Deepana (enhances digestive activity).

As per Gayadaasa (commentator of Sus`hruta Samhitaa), any trauma induced penile edema is called as Upadams`ha (Trauma due to nail, teeth etc.) (S.Ni.12/7 Gayadaasa) Upadams`ha is classified in to five types: Vaataja Pittaja Kaphaja Sannipaatiaka Raktaja Chikitsaa: In early stage of Upadams`ha, bloodletting should be done from anterior part of penis by vein puncture method, with prior Snehana and Svedana, so as to avoid spread of disease. Sus`hruta has advised to use Leeches for blood letting (Jalaukaavachaaran`a) S`heeta Lepa / Sechana: To avoid Paaka (local pus formation), Parisheka or Lepa cold substances should be applied over affected local area of penis. S`hodhana: In an aggravated state of Dosha_s, Virechana or Vamana should be given as per indications. It helps to pacify local pain and edema. Nirooha Basti: If patient is weak and Virechana is contraindicated, aggravated Dosha_s should be expelled by Nirooha Basti. Lepa: Application of Lepa prepared with Ghee, sesame oil and honey should be applied in following conditions If abscess is totally matured. After abscess is incised. Vran`a Dhaavana: Incised abscess should be cleansed with decoction of substances like Jambu, Aamra, Triphala, Khadira etc. Vran`a Ropan`a: Taila (oil) prepared with Taila Paaka method from substances like Jambu, Aamra, Triphalaa etc. should be applied over incised wound for better healing. Once dominance of Dosha is judged, the treatment guidelines described in Vran`ashotha Pratishedheeya (A.H.U.25) should be followed. Doshaja Chikitsaa: Lepa / Parisheka with Vaaataghna Dravya Unctuous Lepa and cold Parisheka should be applied. These types are incurable, one should decide the dominance of Dosha_s and treat them accordingly for symptomatic relief. It should be treated as per guidelines described in Dusht`a Vran`a Chikitsaa. Putrefied part of penis should be eliminated. Residual part of penis should be burned with heated Jambvosht`ha S`hastra (surgical instrument having mouth like Jamun(Indian Black Berry) fruit and made up of stone). Honey or Ghee should be applied over adequately burnt wound. (Samyaka Dagdha) Avasthika Chikitsaa: Upadams`ha should be treated with Aalepa, Parisheka, Raktamokshan`a and other purification therapies. Physician should always give more attention to avoid Paaka Avasthaa of Upadams`ha. If it progresses to Paaka Avasthaa, then the treatment is different. 1) S`hastra Karma - In Paaka (matured) stage, due to pus formation, muscular, cutaneous and venous part of penis get vitiated. Appropriate incision should be made over affected area and pus should be evacuated. 2) S`hodhana and Ropan`a Kashaaya (healing decoction) should be applied. Precaution should be taken to avoid maturation stage. Because suppuration in Snaayu, Siraa and Maamsa leads to putrefaction of penis. Med`hraars`ha / Yoni Ars`ha Chikitsaa It is venereal disease. It is polyp like growth over penis along with itching and sticky, reddish secretions. Similarly in females umbrella like growth develops on the internal or external area of vagina is called as Maamsakeelaka. Chikitsaa: This should be treated according to guidelines described in Ars`ha Chikitsaa. Ars`ha (Proud flesh) should be excised and burnt followed by application of cleansing and healing formulation described in Upadams`ha Chikitsaa.

It is of five types as follows: Vaataja Pittaja Kaphaja Saannipaatika Krimija Precautions: Heart is one of the Marma and requires special attention when get afflicted. It is Sadyah Praan`ahara Marma, which is a vital part causing death immediately if afflicted by either vitiated Dosha or extrinsic factors like trauma. Though S`hodhana therapy is not contraindicated in heart diseases, there are some situations where these are advised with taking proper care of the heart and the patient. Generally Panchakarma - S`hodhana therapies are not advised but Samhitaa advise use of S`hodhana before commencing S`hamana Chikitsaa. It is imperative that the patient should be monitored closely during the procedure. S`hodhana in Hridroga: Vaataja Hridroga Vamana is advised by Sus`hrutaachaarya. Pittaja Hridroga Vamana and Virechana both are advised. Kaphaja Hridroga also Vamana and Virechana are advised. Basti is advised in all the three types of Hridroga. All these procedures should be done with care as Marmaaghaata (injury to the heart - by internal cause in this case) can occur due to the stress caused during these procedures or by Atiyoga (excessive purification) or Mithyaa Yoga (imperfect purification) of these procedures.

Krimija Hridroga Krmija Hridroga Chikitsaa The patient should be advised to consume meat and rice with curd and paste of sesame for three days prior to Virechana. After following this regimen Virechana should be administered. Due to this, Krimi in the heart descend from the heart into Rasa and reach the Kosht`ha from there they are eliminated by Virechana. After Virechana, Vid`anga should be used extensively as medicine and in food also. Aavasthika Chikitsaa:  S`hoola Chikitsaa Obstruction to movement of Vaata aggravates Vaata in Aamaas`haya and produces S`hoola. Hence S`hodhana and Langhana Paachana are the choice of treatment.

Paan`d`uroga Introduction: If the person suffering from Paan`d`uroga indulges in diet and life style which vitiates Pitta, it results in Kaamalaa. This disease can manifest directly even without manifestation of Paan`d`uroga. It is of two types: S`haakhaas`hrita Kaamalaa  also known as Ruddhapatha Kaamalaa Kosht` has`haakhaas`hrita Kaamalaa  also known as Bahupitta Kaamalaa. If not specified, Kaamalaa Chikitsaa is generally considered as treatment of Bahupitta Kaamalaa. It is generally said that S`haakhaas`hrita Bahupittaa Kaamalaa is manifested after Kaamalaa while S`haakhaas`hrita Alpapittaa Kaamalaa manifests without prerequisite of Kaamalaa. Saamanya Chikitsaa: As there is vitiated Pitta in large amounts, Virechana is the purification modality of choice. The drugs used for Virechana should have Tikta Rasa and Mridu Virechaka effect. Generally Kaamalaa is the sequel of Paan`d`uroga, hence its medication should not be contradictory to Paan`d`uroga. In both the types after S`hodhana treatment S`hamana is done. S`hamana Dravyaa should be - Pittaghna (drugs which annihilate Pitta) Paan`d`uroga Avirodhi (drugs non conflicting with Paan`d`uroga) Draakshaa Rasa (grape juice) and Aamalakee Rasa (juice of embelic myrobalans) should be used for preparing food as well as for drinking. Laagharaka Chikitsaa (Laagharava / Alasaakhya) When Kumbha Kaamalaa is associated with Jvara, Angamarda, Bhrama, Saada Tandraa and the patient is emaciated, it is called as Laagharaka. D`alhan`a quotes another opinion that Paanakee as Avasthaa of Laagharaka. Ghee prepared by Draakshaa, Gud`oochee and juice of Aamalakee is the medicine of Laagharaka. As it is similar to Kumbha Kaamalaa or a complicated state in Kumbha Kaamalaa it is also difficult to cure. Hence very less medication is suggested for the disease. The only Kalpa suggested by Sus`hruta is medicated ghee. The Dravya used should be Madhura Vipaakee, Pitta S`haamaka and reducing Khara Gun`a.

Vilas Nanal AVP Introduction: The idea behind writing this article is to present the Ayurvedic perspective about a group of skin diseases called collectively Kusht`ha in Ayurveda. It is true that the aim of all the health care delivery systems is to alleviate human suffering and re-establish health. The means adopted by each of them differ considerably. This is due to the differences in the basic tenets of each of them. It is a fact that skin disorders are difficult to eradicate totally. Hence we find diversity in the management approach. Ayurveda has a positive input to give on all the stages I.e. from the formation of skin, its structure, function and the causative factors, Symptomatology and the manifold unique treatment approach that includes Panchakarma. We have tried to present this difference from the contemporary medicine viewpoint, while keep in the Ayurvedic terminology intact and interpreting it in a manner that is the closest in meaning. We do hope that it will generate an interest in his branch of indigenous knowledge system and eliminate the misconception of its being oriental and therefore mystical and exotic; instead of being a logical reproducible, with a sound cause and effect structure. Ayurvedic concept of skin formation At the time of fertilization the Sperm (Pitrija Bhaava) and the Ovum (Maatrija Bhaava) along with other contributing factors come together in the Fallopian Tube, to enter the uterine cavity (Trutiya Aavarta of Grabhaas`hayya). The act of penetration of the cell wall of the Ovum is responsible for a lot of events. It begins with formation of the primordial space (Srotas / representative of Aakaas`ha / space) in it. The first lining is the precursor of all the internal linings (Kalaa). The unified nucleus forms the seat of spirit (Aatman), mind (Manas) and sensory-motor apparatus (Indriyaan`i). The intercellular space is occupied by the nutrient fluid (Rasa). The outer covering is formed by skin (Tvachaa). This is formed in layers like those on a pot of milk on a low fire. The fetal blood (S`hon`ita) is slowly converted by the digestive fire of the fetus (Jaat`haraagni of Garbha). The more is the density of the fetal blood dense/thicker is the resulting skin layer. The slowly converting blood forms progressively thicker layers of skin as well as the outer layers of various internal organs. These layers are as under Vreehi is a rice corn and is used to measure the thickness levels of different skin layers. Conditions like Sidhma Padmineekan`t`aka originate in this layer. Charaka mentions this as Udakadharaa. Udaka + Dharaa which means which holds the aqueous tissue (Lasikaa) within. If this layer is slightly scratched then a watery, yellowish, warm fluid oozes. The one layer, which holds this fluid, is Udakadharaa. Like the first thin layer on slowly heated milk, retains heat under the surface and hastens the process of separation of the cream from the bulk of fluid. This layer of skin is also responsible for retaining the fluids and nourishes the lower layers. In so doing it secretes the unctuous sweat and sebaceous material from the pores (Sveda). In cases of abrasion on the skin a warm, yellowish fluid is secreted is Lasikaa. This layer is the site of all the oozing, weeping lesions. Role of Rasa in skin physiology and Pathology: The food after its first and second stage digestion reaches the heart (Hridaya) for circulation. The primordial nutrient fluid is capable of nourishing all the body constituents. When it is received at various sites of tissue metabolism (Srotas Moola) it is selectively absorbed and processed further to yield the final products of metabolism. In the case of Rasa, the Aahaara Rasa on reaching the heart is taken up by the Rasa Tissue Agni (Dhaatvaagni) for processing. This goes on for the next twenty-four hours. This process of tissue conversion from the nutrient fluid goes on to yield five by products Rasa proper this is the main tissue that is responsible for the functions of reaching nourishment, maintain the fluidity of internal environment, subtle Rakta (Sookshma Rakta) this is utilized in cases of acute or chronic vitiation, depletion of the Rakta to act as a seed around which newer tissue could be built, waster Kapha (Dhaatu, Mala, Kapha) this is the fluid found around the lungs and the heart responsible for the smooth function of these organs, Tissue sub-type (Upadhaatu) these are the subtypes that are designated to carryout specific functions but they are terminal in the sense that they do not yield any new product, menstrual bloods (Raja) failure to conceive leads to liquefaction of the Endometrial lining that flows as menstruation and Breast milk (Stanya) in case of a lactating mother and finally contribution to Ojus. Rasa is only tissue that harbors all three Dosha_s and the movement of all the constituents is through the agency of Rasa, the Ayurvedic management is incomplete without the appropriate Rasaayana / rejuvenation therapy. Rasa the lymph / nutrient fluid circulates all over the body providing nourishment maintaining fluid balance in the internal milieu. It provides the essential passage to Dosha_s to move along its vessels enabling them to perform their respective functions. Thus it controls the fluid balance, body temperature, nourishment of tissues, enhances the softness, color and complexion of skin. Thus Rasa has an important role to play in maintaining the equilibrium of various body constituents and a state of well being health. Role of Rasa in skin pathology: Whenever a causative factor (Hetu) is in contact with the human body, it depending upon its nature and intensity sets a chain of events into motion. This finally culminates in manifestation of disease of slow onset psoriasis, ringworm and eczema (Kusht`ha) or acute onset herpes (Visarpa) or a similar syndrome. Most of the intrinsic disorders are a direct result of abnormal Agni activity resulting in Aama formation, vitiated Dosha_s, but before that can take place the Rasa gets contaminated and then the specific cause causes vitiation of the Dosha_s and contamination of other Dhaatu_s. All the movements of the vitiated or normal Dosha_s are through Rasa as vehicle, as Dosha_s do not have a specific Srotas attributed to them. Role of blood in skin disease: In the intra uterine life, the skin is formed as progressive thick layers from slowly converting fetal blood. This has an important role in the formation of various body constituents. No organ can be formed without the participation of blood in some form or other. With this background Sus`hruta the great surgeon of ancient times equates blood with life itself. In later life after delivery the nourishment of skin, is done by nourishing first fluid tissue (Rasa) and muscle tissue (Maamsa). Ayurveda has made an interesting observation that it attributes a confirmatory tactile perception to blood (Asams`haya Sparsha Dnyaana) along with sustaining life. This explains the various tactile Parasthesias found in skin disease like itching (Kand`oo), burning (Daaha), pricking sensation (Toda) etc. therefore the advice for bloodletting in the management of skin disorders is sound and is practiced extensively by the Ayurvedic fraternity. Role of muscle tissue in skin disease: The skin formed of the blood in the intrauterine life, in later life is nourished by muscle tissue. Both have the same function of covering the body and various organs by forming an external wall. As seen before the innermost skin layer is made up of muscle and it supports various vessels that carry various fluids within them. Other important function of the muscle is to bring about various movements in the body like ambulation, circulation. This it does by a series of controlled and rhythmic contraction and relaxation of opposing groups of muscles with the help of synergistic muscles. Arteries, veins, organ walls and even the cell walls are made up of muscle tissue. Some of the more grave conditions like Herpes (Visarpa) do involve the muscular layer; some other conditions like Fistula in ano (Bhagandara), causes deep situated eruptions (Visphot`a) etc. Role of reproductive tissue (S`hukra) in skin disorders: Ayurveda considers reproductive activity at two levels. First is the reproductive proper and the second is regenerative activity, capacity to create a similar body constituent. Various factors like Vaayu, Pitta and Kapha also pitch in the act, but the main factor is the S`hukra. Hence the membrane bringing about this phase transition of AAahaara Rasa to S`hukra is spread all over the body (S`hukradharaa Kalaa). This is the reason most of the rejuvenating agents (Rasaayana) are potent aphrodisiacs (Vrishya). Normal skin color, luster and skin glow is due to proper S`hukra. Hence in conditions that are characterized by discoloration consideration to S`hukra is important. Role of incompatible attributes, food articles, regimen indulgence in manifestation of skin disorders (Viruddha Aahaara Vihaara) This is an important contribution to the field of pathogenesis of almost all the intrinsic disorders. Some substances are wholesome singly but on combination with one or more of other equally wholesome substances, the combination more often than not proves harmful to the body. The combination on coming in contact with the Agni proves beyond its capacity, hence it is not converted in the alimentary canal to Aahaara Rasa but it leads to generation of a toxic sticky material called Aama. It is partially processed metabolite hence the molecular size is much large than the normal nutrient fluid. It is sticky, dense, cold, slimy, and unctuous. It leads to obstruction of various channels, vessels. This results in deprived nourishment to other physiologically more distally situated tissues. Again depending upon the specific combination the resultant vitiation varies. Fish and milk, when consumed together lead to manifestation of skin diseases characterized by oozing. Strong sauna or steam bath repeatedly followed by ice cold shower leads vitiation of sweat metabolism (Svedavaha Srotas) culminating in deranged fat metabolism and sometimes skin diseases. Causative factors (Hetu): A variety of factors have been identified as causative factors of skin disorders. Since there is impairment of skin as discoloration, ulceration, scaling, oozing, pus formation, raising and selling these are collectively called Kusht`ha. The causative factors for skin disorders are as follows consumption of incompatible food combinations (Viruddha Aahaara) e.g. improper use of honey, molasses, jaggery, fish, raddish, beans, (Dolichos lablab Linn) jackfruit, barley, black gram (Phaseolus mungo Linn), horse gram (Dolichos Biflorus Linn), improperly set Yogurt /curds, food articles made from fine mesh flour white bread, pasta, noodles, paste of sesame, peanuts. Milk with alcohol (Rum punch), fish (Fish chowder), salty (salted biscuits), sour substances (lemon ice cream, sour cream), fruit (pineapple milk shake); use of oils from rapeseed, Saff flower, sesame seed (Sesamum indicum), suppression of vomit (Chhardi Nigraha), improper administration of purificatory measures (Panchakarma Apchaara), mental factors like fear (Bhaya) fatigue / lassitude (S`hrama), anger (Krodha), fatty / grease rich food persistently and in significant amounts, vegetable / hydrogenated oils, excessive indulgence in sex (Ati Vyavaaya), exercise (Vyaayaama), repeated exposure to strong sun (Aatapa Sevaa), excessive water intake more than 2000 ml / day excessive fat intake more than 20 gm / day sudden and extreme change of temperature sauna / steam bath followed by ice cold shower, consuming cold water before hot beverage, dousing eyes with cold after exposure to sun etc. consuming food in spite of persistent indigestion (Ajeern`a Bhojana). Pathogenesis (Sampraapti) These factors on coming in contact with the body affect the Agni function adversely resulting in generation of Aama instead of Rasa. This is a metabolite that is contaminating in nature since it is gross (Sthoola), slimy / sticky (Pichchhila), cold (S`heeta), heavy (Guru) and slow (Manda) in attributes. It is partly or incompletely converted hence is incapable of nourishing but highly contaminating and occluding in nature. Since it has access to all the sites and channels of Rasa it can have a varied and generalized spread of its signs and symptoms. Since the skin is the main site that represents the status of Rasa in the body the majority of them manifest themselves on the skin causing disfigurement. These can be localized like scabies, ringworm, bullae, macuels, paules, pustules etc. to generalized manifestation like psoriasis, leprosy, (Galat Kusht`ha / Mahaa Kusht`ha), vitiligo (S`hvitra), herpes zoster (Visarpa). Prodromal signs and symptoms (Kusht`ha Poorva Roopa) of skin disease. The imminent skin conditions indicate them by producing some Prodromal signs and symptoms. They are as follows, either lack or excessive sweating (Asvedanam Atisvedanam Vaa), hardness or excessive smoothness of skin (Parushyam Ati S`hlakshn`ata Vaa), discoloration (Vaivarn`ya), itching, Pruritus (Kan`d`oo), pricking pain (Nistoda / Toda) diminished or lack of sensation (Suptata), generalized burning sensation (Paridha), Hyperaesthesia (Pariharsha), Horripilation (Romaharsha), roughness of skin (Karatvam), release of heat like a wave (Ushmaayanam), thickening, subjective heaviness (Gauravam), Oedema (S`hvayathu / S`hotha), repeated and acute episode of eruptions on skin (Visarpa Aagamanam Abhikshn`am), discharge from body orifices (Kaayaa Chhidra Upadeha), excruciation pain in previous lesions, burns, bites, stings, traumatic wounds, ulcers, fractures etc (Pakva Dagdha Dasht`a Bhagna Kshata and Skhalita Ati Maatra Vedanaa), putrefaction and non healing of even smaller wounds (Svalpa Vran`aanaam Api Dusht`i Asamrohan`am cha) Give English name first and Samskrita name in parenthesis () do it for all the names below (this chapter is to put forth the Ayurvedic thinking about skin disorders hence I think the Ayurvedic terminology has to precede the possible allopathic equivalent and not vice versa) Alasaka Kusht`ha - In this the skin gets covered with erythematous itchy nodules. Lichen planus, pityriasis rosea, dermatitis herpetiformis an eczema poplosum Other conditions than those described above are: (Visarpa) herpes of various types including conditions like pemhigus of various types, (S`hvitra / Kilaasa) Leucoderma / Vitiligo, (Romaantikaa) chicken pox, (S`hitalikaa) small pox, Prameha Pid`akaa (carbuncles of diabetes mellitus), (Vran`a S`hotha) etc. Management of skin diseases (Kusht`ha Chikitsaa) S`hodhana purificatory management (Panchakarma) Since the pathology is accumulating and occluding in nature the aim of management is on purification (S`hodhana / Panchakarma). If properly administered, this cleanses the internal environment and improves Agni function while getting the vitiated Dosha_s physically out of the system. But if administered improperly or is inadequate, the result is aggravation of the disease for which it was done. Since the main factor is Agni and the resultant Rasa Nutrients: S`hodhana has to be done repeatedly and diligently. Since most of the constituents involved in the pathogenesis are represented in the various skin layers the relationship between Rasa and skin is that of host and subject. It is very important that optimum purity and functionality of Rasa be maintained at all times. The movement of Dosha all over the body is through the medium of Rasa. These Dosha_s are generated in the gut as result of the first stage digestion. From there they are secreted in the vessels and carried to heart for circulation. In order to purify the Rasa and purify the internal environment the trend from gut to the constituents is to be reversed. They have to be bought to the gut to be eliminated from the nearest orifice. (Vamana) English Word GIRST medically administered vomiting. This is administered to rid the Kapha dominant Dosha, from the stomach (Aamaas`haya). In the preceding week a patient is given a combination of herbs in the form of medicated ghee (Mahaa Tiktaka Ghrita), in increasing doses till he shows symptoms of saturation of the internal environment with ghee (Samyak Snigdha Lakshan`a). During this time he is advised a certain regimen (Sneha Parihaara). He is given a whole body massage either with sesame oil or medicated oil with base of Azadiracta indica (Nimba / Neem seed oil or Neem oil), or Pongamia pinnata see oil (Karanja Taila). Sudation (Svedana) is done be steam using the same herbs. On the previous night the patient is given a specific diet aimed at precipitating the Dosha. It contains fish, jaggery, black gram (Phaseolus mungo), and sesame seeds / paste, Yogurt, banana etc. On the day of Vamana, in the morning, just prior to the main procedure (Pradhaana karma), he is given a mixture of Yogurt, banana and common salt or Yogurt, banana and jaggery to drink. This is followed by massage to the whole body, followed by fomentation by steam. Then a paste in honey of Randia spinosa seed powder (Madana Phala Pippalee), Acorus calamus (Vachaa) rhizome powder and powder of Glycyrrhiza glabra root (Yasht`imadhu) is give. On symptoms of impending vomiting a decoction (Kvaatha) of neem leaves is given till the yellow bile is expelled. Depending upon the end result of vomiting, the dietary restrictions are imposed and a graded diet is followed till the normal diet is allowed. This is known as post Vamana regimen (Paschaata Karma) Like Vamana English word after the normal diet the patient is again given Mahaatiktaka Ghrita in increasing doses till saturation and on the third day after the Oleation (Snehana) is finished a therapeutic purging (Virechana) is done to eliminate Dosha from the small intestine (Pachyamaanaas`haya). The day between Oleation and purging, the patient is asked to consume a weak infusion (Phaant`a / Siddha Jala) of Cassia fistula (Aaragvadha), Vitis vinifera (Draakshaa / black resins) The purging medication is administered around 0930 hrs. The common herb used is Operculum turpethum (Trivruta), Cassia fistula (Aaragvadha) or a combination of some herbs called Avipattikara Choorn`a. The bouts of loose motions continue till a white jelly like mucus is passed. Depending upon the amount of Dosha_s evacuated the dietary regimen is followed for another five to nine or twelve days. In case of Vaayu predominance, medicated enemata (Basti of decoctions (Nirooha) or oils for retention (Anuvaasana) are administered. For the enema decoction five bitter barks (Pancha Tikta Kvaatha Nirooha Basti with sesame oil, rock salt) is given just after sunrise. The retention enema is given in the late afternoon immediately after a snack. For both enemata the patient is in a left lying position after previous oleation and sudation are along with other purificatory measures. Sometimes the Dosha_s are harboring (Leena Dosha Avasthaa) in the Dhaatu_s and the attempts to precipitate them (Dosha Utkles`hana) and bring them back to the alimentary canal (Kosht`ha Aanayana) are not plausible. Sometimes a correctly diagnosed disease does not respond to the appropriate treatment adopted. There the affliction should be considered as arising out of vitiated blood and blood letting (Rakta Mokshan`a- As`ra Visruti) should be carried out. In case of local lesion depending upon the Dosha predominance, various methods like application of Leeches (Jalaukaa Avacharan`a) taking incisions (Prachchhaana Karma), sucking by cupping with carved bullock horn (S`hrunga). Prior oleation, fomentation and precipitation are done as usual. The dietary regimen restriction on behavior, remain the same as in other measures. The palliative (S`hamana Chikitsaa) is done after the purificatory treatment and consists of conversion. Conversion of undigested or partly digested food residue (Aama Pachana). This includes use of medicinal herbs, fasting, or a particular kind of diet, hot or prepared water using herbs like Acacia catechu (Khadira), Cassia tora seeds (Chakramarda), the Three myrobalans Terminalia chebula (Haritakee), Terminalia bellerica (Bibhitaka), Emblica officinalis (Aamalaki). Minerals like sulphur (Gandhaka) and some animal products too, in appropriate form and dosage with its vehicle (Anupaana) see the list of herbs next page. Since the main involved constituent is the skin it is important to treat the lesions locally by application anointing the area with various herbs. This process is called Lepa. In case of generalized spread a more rigorous treatment by applying (Abhyanga) / pouring (Dhaaraa) mediated oils (Taila Dhaaraa) or buttermilk (Takra Dhaaraa) which is prepared using herbs like Cyperus rotundus rhizome, N. Jatamamsi root and Emblica officinalis fruit powder. The milk for making curds with these powders is set and then buttermilk is prepared from the set curds. This is used after the whole body massage for a period of 45 minutes (one Muhurta). The unctuousness of oil and buttermilk is removed using herbal powder (Udvartana) like Azadiracta indica leaves, Acacia catechu, three myrobalans, Phaseolus mungo etc. to reduce sweating and contamination it is advised to fumigate the clothes of a person suffering, with powders of Acorus calamus, Azadiracta indica leaves, Brassica / mustard seeds, olio resin from Commiphora mukul, roxb. (Guggulu). Role of Ghrita in the management of skin disorders: As seen before the main function of the skin is to retain moisture in the body and secrete the unctuousness sebum out of the pores to maintain the control on Vaayu and Vaata activity. Fluid and unctuous are two attributes of Jala Mahabhoota or water element, one of the five elements but they have strikingly different functions in the body. The fluid is responsible for the fluid balance; adequate movement of nutrients while the unctuous is responsible for maintaining the lubrication chain in the internal environment. Both have differing physical attributes and cannot mix freely, the one factor responsible for keeping them in an emulsion / miscible form is the digestive power (Agni) of the individual. Ghrita an end product of milk, is an ideal substance that has a unique action on the body constituents, it has a beneficial soothing effect on the unctuous chain (Dhaatu Sneha Paramparaa) of the tissues. It also has a facilitatory effect on digestive fire and tissue conversion. It also is comparable to the sublime and pure essence of tissues (Ojus). It controls the physiological metabolism of the tissues and ensures smooth and optimum function for sustenance of life. Ghrita is important at various levels of management. In the purificatory stage it helps remove the vitiated Dosha from the tissue without causing damage to them. In the palliative phase it ensures optimum digestive function and reduces the chances of Aama formation. It also ensures an adequate supply of unctuous, lubricant, material for various physiological processes to continue. After the condition is cured it is advisable to follow the seasonal purification regime as preventive management. After the purification one has to ensure that the disease does not recur on provocation. Towards this end no Ayurvedic treatment is complete without proper rejuvenation (Rasaayana). For skin disorders use of Ghrita is a good rejuvenator along with herbs that are Rasaayana like Glyceriza Glabra, Hemidesmus indicus, and three Myrobalans etc. A list of some herbs used in Kusht`ha Management from the texts.

Chi.19 Introduction: In pathogenesis of Kusht`ha, all three Dosha are involved which in turn vitiate Tvak (skin), Rakta (blood), Maamsa (muscle tissue) and Ambu. Considering dominance of Dosha, treatment should be planned. This disease requires It is Nitya S`hodhanaarha Vyaadhi. Saamaanya Chikitsaa: All the types of Kusht`ha are Tridoshaja. The treatment is depends upon the symptom and condition of the Dosha which is more predominant and the Anubandhita Dosha is treated consequently. S`hodhana is indicated in Bahudosha Avasthaa. Physician should be vigilant about the life of the patient, as excessive elimination makes the patient weak, hence the aggravated Vaata can be dangerous. In this condition Vamana procedure should be done once in 15 days, Virechana procedure once in a month, S`hirovirechana once in 3 days and Rakta mokshan`a once in 6 months. S`hamana is indicated in Alpa Doshaavasthaa. Vishesha Chikitsaa: After Blood letting, when the patient regains strength should be oleated and carefully subjected to Vamana with drastic formulations, followed by purgation and bloodletting. In case where in the indicated S`hodhana is not done, the aggravated Dosha permeate the whole body and the disease becomes incurable; hence Dosha should be eliminated completely. Every morning suitable purgatives should be used for 5, 6, 7 or 8 days so that the Dosha do not raise their heads again. Similar Chikitsaa: Visarpa Avasthika Chikitsaa: Alpa Dosha Avasthaa: - Prachchanna After only the Dosha are eliminated from the Kosht`a and Rakta, the patient should be administered oleation therapy as Vaayu gets aggravated after the elimination therapies. Rakta Visraavan`a in Lalat`a (forehead), Hasta (hand) and Paada (legs). By administering proper blood letting, internal and external alleviation therapies and oleation at appropriate time Kusht`ha which are curable finally get cured. Kusht`ha is very difficult to cure. To get rid of this disease it is necessary to have faith in the dietary and behavioral regimen as told by Ayurveda. It is also necessary to consume specific treatment, to get in to religious austerity. Then only, person become free from the disease and also attains the perpetual happiness (peace or calmness of mind, absence of passion) Dhaatugata Kusht`ha Chikitsaa: Tvakgata(Rasagata)Kusht`ha: S`hodhana and Lepana Raktagata Kusht`ha: S`hodhana, Lepana, Kashaaya Paana, S`hon`itaavasechana Maamsagata Kusht`ha: S`hodhana, Lepana, Kashaaya Paana, S`hon`itaavasechana, Arisht`a, Mantha, Praasha. Medagata Kusht`ha: The disease becomes manageable if the patient has self -control and has all adequate means of treatment. In such case use of Bhallataka, S`hilaajatu, Maaks`hika etc. should be adopted. If the disease proceeds to Asthi Dhaatu it is considered as incurable, hence should not be treated.

These substances are applied to the skin or administered into body cavities for extended periods, allowing them to interact with specific mucous membranes and enhance their function. \n\nThe method of administering these substances into body cavities is called Basti. It is primarily done through the rectum into the large intestines, but can also be administered into the uterus through the vagina or into the bladder through the urethra. Basti is distinct from enemas, which are used to cleanse the large intestines and rectum with irritants or water to facilitate bowel movements. Basti, on the other hand, aims to dwell within the body for a longer period, allowing the interventive material to be absorbed and enhance the capacity of the organ.\n\nThere are three main types of Basti:\n\n1. Anuvaasana Basti: Predominantly consists of oils or ghee.\n2. Nirooha Basti: Contains less oil and more decoction of herbs.\n3. Maatraa Basti: A type of Anuvaasana Basti, it is one of the safest and least complicated varieties, with a small volume of approximately 60 ml.\n\nMaatraa Basti is indicated for various clinical conditions where tissue building is necessary due to insufficient nourishment. It is particularly beneficial in conditions such as paralysis, osteoporosis, muscular emaciation, and epilepsy.\n\nThe procedure for administering Maatraa Basti involves preparing the patient, warming the medicated oil, inserting a catheter into the anus, and gently pushing the oil into the rectum. The patient is then advised to rest for several hours and avoid passing stools for up to two hours. This allows the oil to be absorbed and exert its therapeutic effects.\n\nBasti therapy has been shown to be effective in treating a wide range of diseases, particularly those related to Vaata (air and space) imbalances.

The advice of applications of such material is spread all over the texts. Instead of application to the skin, only the warm oils and decoctions are allowed to dwell in hollows of the body for a stipulated period. By dwelling in they come in contact with the specific mucous membrane, improvise the structure and thus function in that locality. So the method of making a material to dwell in the hollow, facility to be in and such interventive material is called Basti. The majority of such push-to-dwell in are through the rectum in the large intestines, and they are mistranslated as enema. The intention of enema is mostly of introduction of some irritant / secretogogue, volume to hasten movement of obstructed contents outside; the intention in administering Basti is to dwell inside for a much longer spell, so that absorption of the interventive material can augment the capacity of the organ. The entry is mainly through three orifices: Pakvaas`haya (Large intestines) through rectum; or Into Garbhaas`haya (Uterus) through vagina or Into Mootraas`haya (Bladder) through urethra. It is done with the help of Basti Yantra and it can be called as intra-rectal. According to modern science enema is said to be the cleaning of the large intestines and rectum with the help of soap water or warm water whenever a patient gets constipation. In Basti there are many food items rather than only irritants introduced into the body. The dominant mixture ingredients are mainly of two varieties of I.R. (2). Anuvaasana (Predominance of oils or ghee) and Nirooha (less oil and more decoction of herbs) Maatraa Basti is one of the varieties of Anuvaasana Basti and it is one of the safest and least uncomplicated. Its volume is very small, equal to 60 ml approximately. It is indicated in all clinical conditions, where building of tissues is the need arising out of less nourishment (Apatarpan`ajanya Vyaadhi) (3) MAATRAA BASTI INDICATIONS: - Vaataavyaadhi_s Paks`haaghaata Sandhivaata Balaapahata Kat`is`hoola Gridhrasee Manyaashoola Osteoporosis Avascular Necrosis Pseudomuscular hypertrophy. Muscular emaciation. Apasmaara (Epilepsy). 100 ml of metal or plastic syringe. Rubber catheter according to the age. Medicine a) Medicated oil, fat. b) Medicated ghee Dose: 15 to 30 ml - children 30 to 60 ml - adults Duration: 8 days or 16 days. PROCEDURE: - Poorva Karma (Preparatory) i) The Patient should be asked to pass urine and stools to avoid chance of uncontrolled evacuation or undue holding. ii) Oil massage should be done to the whole body or locally i.e. back, abdomen and buttocks for 10 to15 minutes. iii) Hot fomentation should be given with controlled medicated steam by a tube or with a hot water bag for 10 to 15 minutes. Pradhaana Karma (Main procedure): - i) The patient should lie down on the table on his left side, flexing the right hip and knee, and putting on his left leg. ii) Warm medicated oil mixed with 1 gram of rock salt. iii) Warm medicated oil should be taken into a syringe and the catheter must be fixed by removing the air completely from it by pressing the piston of the syringe. iv) After applying oil to the anus insert oil-smeared catheter, slowly into anus up to 3\" length, and then slowly and gently push the oil in to the rectum without jerk. v) Slowly remove the catheter and do a light massage and give gentle jerks on the buttocks. Paschaata Karma (last procedure): - 1) After every five minutes ask the patient to change the postures from left lateral to prone posture and from prone to right lateral and from right lateral to supine relaxed posture. If the patient is below 5 years, the parent should be asked to hold, him so as to avoid harmful movements. Encourage the patient to take complete rest for 2 to 3 hours, and as far As possible he should be advised not to pass stools up to 2 hours. After 2 hours he can be allowed to pass stools OPD patient should be allowed to go home and take rest. When the patient gets a good appetite, he should be given hot and fresh lentil-rice (Khichad`i) combination. Hot water should be given throughout the treatment period. For O.P.D. patients, however, care should be taken to avoid physical as well as mental strain. The patient should be advised to sleep early. Patient should be advised about the principles of the treatment and asked to follow throughout the course to obtain maximum results. 2) Maadhu Tailika Basti Maadhu Tailika a combine of honey and oil is one of the varieties of S`hodhana Basti and the safest among all. It can be used for VIPS, Business executives, Old persons etc. (4) NIROOHA BASTI: Due to the more absorbable ingredients, Anuvaasana is to dwell in the body for a longer period. With repetition of these, there is the necessity to clear the extra oily component. For this the medicated decoctions, administered in between; cleanse, Dosha_s and Mala_s from the body. This is known as Nirooha - one responsible for doing away extra oiliness, due to continued Basti_s. Care must be taken that Anuvaasana should be given before and after the Nirooha Basti. The Basti, which is dominant in decoction, instead of oils, fats; is also known as Kashaaya Basti. Due to its beneficial effect on a longer span of life, it has been called, Aasthaapana Basti. All Vaatavyadhi_s. Sandhivaata Aamavaata Pakshaaghaata Gridhrasee Madhumeha Malabaddhataa Aadhmaana UTI infection All Dhaatu Vikaara_s Osteoporosis. Avascular necrosis. Powders of Das`hamoola Triphal`aa Erand`a Moola Rock salt Honey Cows urine, all these remove the oily material, so a little sesame oil is added. Poorva Karma (Preparatory procedure): 25gms. of the above mentioned powder, add 400 ml. of water. On the slim flame reduce it to 100 or 50 ml. Strain and use the decoction in required proportion. 50gms of honey, 10gms of rock salt, churn along with chutney. After mixing, pour 50ml of sesame oil slowly and at the end add 300ml to 400ml decoction. After mixing properly keep in hot water-bath, to maintain warmth, for use. Before administration of S`hodhana the patient should have had Anuvaasana earlier. Pradhaana Karma (Main procedure): - be sure that the patient comes with an empty stomach. The procedure as advised earlier is to be followed. Paschaata Karma (end procedure): - Reassure the patient, inquire about any pain, and advise rest, at least for two hours. With proper appetite, rice munga preparation, freshly cooked along with warm water to drink, should be advised throughout the treatment. In the evening, a hot and light diet is advised. In the situation of no passage of stools, once again he is administered S`hodhana in larger quantity. The next day morning the patient should continue Anuvaasana Basti. By improvising the area responsible for absorption, by proper separation of sticky layers, there is cleansing of all the channels, fluid exchange mechanism gets toned up; extra Dosha_s are propagated outside, whereby the strength of tissues is improved. It results in rejuvenation, which improves longevity and memory and complexion too. By nature it is antiVaata procedure, and by maximizing tissue wear tear it normalizes other components too. Basti is the choicest remedy to compensate the effects of Vaata exacerbation as termed Vaataharaan`aam Shresht`ham\" (6) and therefore it is the best therapy to treat all Vaata Vyaadhi_s and Aachaarya Sus`hrita aptly described that, it is useful not only for Vaata, but also for Pitta, Kapha, Rakta and in complex combination of two, three (Samsarga and Sannipaata) Dosha_s (7) Basti is not similar to enema, because of its nourishing potential; hence it should not to be misunderstood as enema. Basti, management is labeled as total (for Kaaya Chikitsaa) and of entire management in Ayurveda. Pharmaco Dynamics of Basti  Using the simple examples of daily life easily does the explanations of actions. Intra Rectal, dominate in food items rather than medicinals. The tissues on the verge of weakness are refreshed / rejuvenated by courses of intra-rectals. It is compared to watering of a dry plant, to have the recovery of the turgid cells once again. As the actions are noted at so many levels of tissues regeneration, broad spectrum is probably the most appropriate term. It acts as Rasaayana (to rejuvenate,) Vrishya (Aphrodisiac); Brimhan`a (Anabolic) because of its capacities to contribute to the building of tissues; and it is indicated in a (Kris`ha) or emaciated persons to increase the quality and quantity of Dhaatu_s; and in (Sthaulya) obesity to streamline the unwanted obesity components (9). The clinically observed effects at times surprise the scientists, especially in background of prevalently accepted medical sciences. A volume of fat, with or without herbal decoction, with temperatures around 38-43 degree Celsius, allowed to dwell in the lower zone of gastro-intestinal tract; for a stipulated bearable period, produces a spectrum of actions. But the area of Apaana-Vaata by its controlling capacity of rest Vaata types, does so. Here it is the distinct concept is to be digested, rather than pharmacological action of the substance dwelling in. Basti_s show significant results in almost all diseases, by its very distinct actions on Vaata zone. The fact is therefore explained with suitable analogies. : Trees are irrigated at its root level, and in due course of time, develop branches rich with beautiful tender leaves, flowers and fruits. So the administered decoction in the rectum, due to the main absorbing area, (Guda) produces results positive from head to toe 10) (11). (See illustration) Basti eliminates the vitiated Dosha_s. Medicines, which are administered through the rectal route, are absorbed in the rectum and large intestines. The rectum has rich blood and lymph supply and drugs can cross through the rectal mucosa like other lipid membranes. Aachaarya Paaras`hara opined long ago, anus (Guda) is the main route of the body having blood vessels in it, nourishes the whole body. The technical term for this part of the track is Paayu. i.e. one which is capable of absorbing oil through its layers, is the grammatical derivation of the term; the most appropriate. The superior haemorrhoidal veins in the portal circulation carry the portion, which is absorbed from the upper rectal mucosa, whereas the middle and inferior haemorrhoidal veins absorb from the lower rectal mucosa, and thus enters directly into the Systemic Circulation. The rectum with its vascularity and venous plexus provides a good circulation, producing the effects more quickly without affecting the liver where they may be differently metabolized. Soon after the intake, to facilitate digestion at proximal part, the pyloric sphincter contracts for proper digestion. The Kapha`s transient dominance, in Kapha-Prapaaka stage extends due to Anuvaasana particularly and enhances the (Brimhan`a) tissue - building effect. The alimentary canal is open on both sides. With any intake automatically the pyloric sphincter tightly closes, and by intra-rectal at the same time the chances of dwelling in are increased to achieve tissue building. Pharmacodynamics of S`hodhana Basti: - The decoction predominant Basti enters into the large intestine, and gets absorbed a little earlier, as the contents are less thick. The medicine component enhances elimination of waste materials, from tissue level and brings to the hollow area to throw out from the body. In other words it can be hypothetically explained that, being a hyper tonic solution (Nirooha Basti) after entering the large intestines, the fluids may traverse because of osmosis from hypo tonic to hyper tonic solutions i. e. fluid along with the unwanted pathological material, dragged from intracellular and extra cellular level into the large intestines and thrown out from the body. The choice of an empty stomach for this is specific of S`hodhana Basti. Expected to come out with in (one Muhurta) 45min.to avoid many complications. S`hodhana Basti should be given on empty stomach as explained in Aasthaapana Basti. With Ayurvedaic and other rationales so perused, the statements about, half or total management, by intra-rectal, solely or only can be appreciated with certain clinical evaluations. Maatraa Basti: - Clinically Maatraa Basti has shown different properties in various diseases. I. In polio Balaataila Maatraa Basti and Snehana Svedana with Vitous nirgudo crushed leaves restored the muscle power. Girths and the total weight increased significantly after treatment. In the present study the Polio cases were selected from the 0.P.D & I.P.D. and kept under the following treatment groups. To assess the individual muscle power before and after the treatment, all the patients were examined and graded according to the Medical Research Council (0-5) Measurements of all the muscles were noted before and after the treatment. Body weight was recorded before as well as after the treatment. Conclusion: The study has established that continuous Balaa Taila Maatraa Basti is superior to other treatments for acute patients. The statistical and even clinical results have indicated that the recovery is faster than from other treatments. The study has indicated that the muscles of the left knee extensors have gained significant muscle power with continuous Balaa Taila Maatraa Basti in acute cases. The clinical study revealed that the continuous Balaa Taila Maatraa Basti in acute cases is superior to the other treatments, particularly in the improvement of hip extensors of left side affected cases. All the treatments considered in this study have shown statistical significance by 5%, increase in body weight. Statistically it has been proved that, all patients have gained the muscle power at 5% level. Maatraa Basti has not shown any complications and side effects during and after the treatment (Yadaiah1985). II. In Pakshaaghaata (paralysis) , there were significant results with courses of Bastis of As`hvagandhaa Ghrita and Vaata Naas`haka Taila, muscle power significantly increased and many patients become independent . III As`hvagandhaa Ghrita Basti has shown significant results in Sandhivaata (osteo Arthritis). IV. Brihat Saindhavaadi Taila has shown encouraging results in Aamavaata (Rheumatism) patients and laboratory investigations were reported negative for R.A. and ASO titre in number of cases. Lekhana Basti has shown significant reduction in body weight and lipid profile. In this study, patients who possessed the signs and symptoms of Medoroga mentioned in Charaka Samhitaa as well as having a body mass index more than 24 were selected for research trials. Following investigations were done for every obesity patient before and after treatment i.e. blood for Hb%, blood sugar, serum cholesterol, and lipid profile and urine examination. These patients were divided randomly into three groups: Baahya Snehana Baashpa Svedana Lekhana Basti Navaka Guggulu 500 mgs TDS Restricted Aahaara Daily exercises and precautions. Apart from the present day prevalent managements for various conditions, addition or alone use of textually indicated intra-rectal has number of benefits. All scientific details cannot be included for want of place. Certain claims about shifting of pathological values or texts to physiological ones are indicative of therapeutic efficacy. Lekhana for control of obesity; Maadhu Tailika for control of neuro-muscular stroke, situations; medicated milk administration by Basti for antacid potential; intra-rectal of volume of churned gum-olio-resin of S`haalmaeei, in ulcerative irritational malabsorbtive conditions are a few taken from a long list. Group \u2011 II: In this group the patients were kept on Navaka Guggulu 500mgs TDS for 90 days along with a restricted diet and Vihaara. Group \u2011 III: In this group patients were kept on placebo for 90 days along with restricted diet and Vihaara. It is observed from the clinical study, that the group I (Lekhana Basti) therapy is most effective with respect to body mass index (1% level of significance), body weight (1% level), subjective symptoms such as Daurbalya (5% level), Anga Gaurava (1% level) Sandhi S`hoola (1% level) and Trishn`aadhikya (5% level), bio-chemical investigation serum Cholesterol (1% level) and did not produce any significant changes in blood pressure or the respiratory rate Table showing the mean reduction of body weight in-group I, II, III.

The HDL values were increased by -7.524 in average. The LDL values were changed slightly. Group\u2011I therapy is the best with respect to Triglyceride value (1% level of significance) and HDL value (1% level of significance). (Kulkarni & Yadaiah 1996).  Clinical trials of Maadhu Tailika Basti in Pakshaaghaata . Investigations: \u2011 The following investigations were carried out on all the patients before and after the treatment: 1) Urine examination 2) Blood for Hb%. ESR, TLC, DLC, Serum protein, Serum Cholesterol, Blood Sugar and VDRL etc. From the above study the following conclusions were drawn: 1. Statistically significant results have been observed in all the three groups. 2. Maadhu Tailika Basti has been proved to be an effective medicine for Pakshaaghaata. 3. In present mechanical era the Maadhu Tailika Basti is a safest, uncomplicated and time saving method of Basti and it is free from untoward effects. 4. It has also seen that, this Basti can be administered in OPD level. 5. In G1 group, the significant raise in protein levels (t+\u2011 16.48 P<0.10) and significant reductions in ESR levels (t+_ 1.68;P<0.10) were seemed. 6. In G2 group, significant reduction was seen in Blood sugar levels (t+_2.193; P<0.05) and ESR levels (t+3.268; P<0.01) 7. Significant increase in Hb% (t+_1.97; P<0.05) was seen in G3 group. 8. Serum cholesterol levels have not shown any significant change in any group. 9. Grading scale has shown statistically significant improvement in all the symptoms of three groups. 10. Marked improvement was seen in 38.23% patients, 50% patients were moderately relieved and mild relief was observed in 11.7%. Cases. 11. In the improvement and response, there is no difference have been noted in relation to the effect of the side (right or left) 12) Blood sugar is significantly reduced in G2 group, it suggests that, further study is required is this direction. 13. From above study it is very clear that, Maadhu Tailika Basti is very useful uncomplicated and the safest variety of Basti. It can be administered to any body at any time and in all walks of life, as said by Aachaarya Sus`hruta (Yadaiah 1983). 13) In this clinical study 125 polio cases were selected from Ayurveda Hospital, Kaayachikitsaa Dept. Akola (1985 to 1990) Polio cases were divided randomly in to three groups: Group I: - 68 polio cases were kept under the management of Snehana Svedana (Vaata S`haamaka Taila and Nirgun`d`i Patra Svedana) for a period of 2 months. Group II: \u2011 23 cases were kept under the Pin`d`a svedena for a period of 15 to 21 days continuously after application of Vaata S`haamaka Taila. Group III: \u2011 34 cases were received Vaata S`haamaka Taila Maatraa Basti for a period of 8 days continuously along with Snehana and Svedana. From this study it has been observed that the lower limb (LL) affected cases have shown good improvement whereas both LL affected cases have not shown encouraging results. However in these cases one limb (either left or right) has got improvement in their muscle power up to 3\u20114 grade and another LL has got 1\u20112 grade muscle power. 2) Children affected with UL have not shown encouraging results. 3) Maatraa Basti has shown comparatively encouraging results than other treatments (Yadaiah 1989). Ksheera Basti Ksheera Basti in Amlapitta patients In this study 24 Amlapitta the patients were kept on Ksheera Basti. The patients who had the symptoms of vomiting, belching, hotness, headache, loss of appetite anxiety, constipation, general weakness and abdominal pain were kept on Ksheera Basti treatment. The patients were divided into three groups according to the intensity and duration of disease. Group I: In this group 12 patient were kept on Ksheera Basti for 8 days duration. Group II: In this group 6 patients were kept on 16 days Ksheera Basti continuously. Group III: In this group 6 Amlapitta patients were kept on 2 courses of 16 days. Ksheera Basti 2nd group (another 16 days) was similarly treated but after a 2 months gap. Maximum (86.38%) Cases of Amlapitta were observed in 21 to 50 year groups. From the study in has been observed that all the symptoms were significantly reduced. The body weight was increased significantly. 4) Vomiting, belching hotness, abdominal pain, were negated completely (Yadaiah 1998). Pichchhaa Basti: In the present study 23 Grahan`i patients were administered the Pichchhaa Basti after Detailed clinical examination. Duration of the treatment: \u2011 6 patient were given 8 days of Pichchhaa Basti, 6 patients were given 16 days and 11 patients were given more than 16 Pichchhaa Basti to get complete relief. The signs and symptoms like abdominal pain, mucus stool, loose motions, palpitation, indigestion belching, anxiety and disturbed sleep were relieved significantly and their body weight increased statistically significant at 5% level.

Saamaanya Chikitsaa: All types of Madaatyaya are Tridoshaja only. Hence the treatment should be based on the predominance of the Dosha. Such measures, which help to combat the same Dosha, should be adopted. Kapha Sthaana should be targeted first, as Pitta and Vaata Dosha vitiate later. The disorder which results from intake of Madya in Mithya (improper), Ati (excess) or Heena (less) should be managed by drinking Madya in Sama (endurable) Maatra (dose). Madya due to which the intoxication has set in, the same should be used in appropriate quantity or else the person gets afflicted permanently. Diet and drugs should be cooling, palatable, fragrant and tasty according to Dosha. In all types of Madaatyaya, Sugandhi Gun`a is advised. If any illness is associated with Madaatyaya then it should be treated accordingly along with Madaatyaya. Duration of the treatment: 7 to 8 days. When all the complications subside then eliminative measures such as Vamana and Virechana should be adopted. Madya brings about disturbance in both mind and body, as Harshan`a chikitsa calms down it should be adopted. Anutarsha: This is the dose described or used for drinking spirituous liquors. The dose should be such that it does not cause any disturbance to the mental faculty; on feeling thirsty Madya should be mixed with adequate quantity of water such that it does not cause intoxication. Significance of milk in Madya: (Madaatyaya) Milk, which has similar properties to that of Ojas, replenishes the person who is depleted due to excess of drinking. Avasthika Chikitsaa: If there is excess precipitation of the Dosha and the person suffers from excess of burning sensation and thirst, then one should infer that Kapha and Pitta Dosha are excessively vitiated in the Aamashaya and measures to counteract should be adopted. Daaha: When the heat of Madya gets combined with Pitta and Rakta reaches the skin, Daaha appears. Pittaghna Chikitsa measures should be adopted in this case. For vitiated blood circulation, Langhana is advised. Also meat soup of wild animals and blood letting from the Rohin`ee veins situated in the extremities is advised. Treatment similar to Pittaja Jvara should be adopted. If Daaha is due to suppression of thirst, all such measures which are cooling and similar to Pittaja Jvara should be adopted.

Oorustambha Introduction: Oosrustambha (Oorugraha) is the disease in which the movement of the thigh muscles is hampered due to severe stiffness. Kapha and Medas along with Vaata are the responsible factors. Precaution: Oosrustambha (Oorugraha) is the only disease where Panchakarma like Basti, Virechana and Vamana are contraindicated. Poorvakarma like Snehana is also contra-indicated. The reason for contraindication is that, Snehana (Oleation therapy) and Anuvaasana Basti; both aggravate Kapha. In the pathogenesis of Oosrustambha, Kapha and Medas are the two mainly involved entities. As has been explained by Charaka, Kapha, Aama and Medas are accumulated in the Ooroo and Janghaa (thighs and leg) causing their stiffness due to their Sthira and S`heeta attributes. Therefore, if Snehana and Basti are done in the patients suffering from Oosrustambha, it will again aggravate Kapha, which in turn will boost up the pathogenesis of Oosrustambha. The prognosis will become graver then before in this situation. Virechana is also contraindicated as Virechana acts on Pitta dominated Dosha. As in the Oosrustambha, Kapha is the main vitiated Dosha, Virechana has got no potency to remove Kapha, which is vitiated and harboured in the thighs. Vamana and Virechana, both the Karma are potent to root out the vitiated Kapha and Pitta in their own sites (Kosht`ha). But when Dosha are aggravated in the thighs (other than their own sites), they are unable to expel them out making any Panchakarma useless in this disease as it becomes very difficult to get the water from deep well. Therefore, Poorvakarma Snehana and Panchakarma like Basti, Vamana and Virechana are contraindicated in Oosrustambha. In Oosrustambha, it is necessary to do the Kshapan`a, S`hoshan`a and Sams`hamana continuously, as there is dominance of Kapha. There should be all the Rooksha Upachaara i.e. use of food and drug having dry attributes. After doing the Rooksha Upachaara (Apatarpan`a), if it has happened in excess, it is necessary to do the Santarpan`a. It is because while doing Apatarpan`a to deplete the Kapha, Vaidya should take care of strength of patient. There should not be the depletion of strength while carrying out the depletion of Kapha. If debility appears, then Charaka has given the food regime to get back the strength. Saamaanya Chikitsaa: Aabhyantara and Baahya both are mentioned. Baahya Chikitsaa: Utsaadana Pralepana Sechana Vishesha Chikitsaa: Associated with excess of Kapha and Aama Dosha  Sams`hamana, Ksapan`a , S`hoshan`a and Yuktyapeksha should be the line of treatment Vihaara: Vyaayaama Yathaa S`hakti Naaree S`heelana (sexual gratification as per Bala) Swimming A special treatment has been mentioned as jumping, walking etc in sand as these bring about Rookshan`a of Kapha Generally, it has been said that Kapha should be depleted (Kapha Kshapan`a) but without aggravation of Vaayu. Anything that can achieve this principle can be done as treatment of Oosrustambha. Digestive capacity (Agni) and physical strength (Bala) should be maintained in the treatment procedure. According to Sus`hruta, Kapha Medaavrita Vaayu is the causative factor in Oosrustambha. Sus`hruta has advised to treat Oosrustambha as per Kapha Medaavrita Vaata. He also says to treat it as S`hotha (specifically Apakva S`hotha). When Kapha and Meda get depleted in substantial amount, then Karma like Snehana can be done. Sus`hruta has advised to use Guggulu in Oosrustambha. The reasons are:- Guggulu is Kaphavaataghna due to its Teekshn`a and Ushn`a attribute. Guggulu pacifies Mala and Pitta due to its Sara attribute. It is Sugandhi (having aroma), therefore it cures Pooti Kosht`ha Vaataghna. It increases Agni by its Sookshma attribute. (Su.

Vamana and Virechana (S`hodhana) should be given after proper Snehana (oleation therapy) with the help of Teekshn`a Dravya. For the same ghee medicated with S`hodhana Dravya can be used. For Snehana Kalyaan`aka Ghrita, Panchagavya Ghrita ,Daadhika ghrita, Kat`vara Ghrita.Aaragvadhaadi Gan`a Siddha Ghrita should be used. Though Vamana is contraindicated in Paan`d`u Vamana should be administered with Mridu Dravyaa_s should be used according to Des`ha Kaala Prakriti etc are used.(D`alhan`a T`eekaa S.U.44 ) Pathyakara Aahaara should be given after proper S`hodhana. S`hamana Kalpaa_s should be given after S`hodhana. Ayas i. e. iron is the best S`hamana Medicine for Paan`d`uroga. Therefore, various Loha formulations should be used e.g. Navaayas Loha, Taapyaadi Loha etc. according to Dosha domination. The formulations used for treating S`hotha are also useful in treating Paan`d`uroga.( A. H. Chi. 16/57) Laghu Panchamoola Siddha Jala (Decoction of Laghu Panchamoola)or Juice of Aamalkee is used for Dietary regime and to drink. Precaution to be taken: - In Paan`d`u, S`hodhana should be done multiple times to expel Dosha Situated in Srotas Dhaatu and Aas`haya completely, as the residual Dosha may cause edema. Vaataja Paan`d`u: S`hodhana as mentioned above. The S`hamana medicine should be predominantly Siddha Ghrita (medicated ghee preparations) Pittaja Paan`d`u: S`hodhana as mentioned above. S`hamana Dravya should be Tikta (bitter) and S`heeta (cold) medicines. Kaphaja Paan`d`u S`hodhana as mentioned above S`hamana Kalpa should be Tikta (bitter), Kat`u (pungent), Rooksha (dry) and Ushn`a (hot). Haritakee soaked in cows urine should be used for Virechana. Sannipaataja Paan`d`u: S`hodhana as mentioned above. S`hamana Kalpa should be selected examining the dominance of Dosha at the respected time. Mridbhakshan`ajanya Paan`d`u: S`hodhana as mentioned above. Teekshn`a S`hodhana Dravyaa_s should be used by examining Vyaadhi Bala (stage of disease) and Rugn`a Bala (condition and strength of suffering person). After S`hodhana, medicated ghee should be used to improve strength. For withdrawal / elimination of the addiction of eating soil, the soil medicated with Krimighna and Tikta (bitter) medicines is used.

He encounters this disease in all its three stages viz. the acute, sub acute and chronic. As all of you have some knowledge of Ayurveda, I shall confine myself to a brief theoretical aspect and then shall present a few cases managed by me. Charaka while describing the Sampraapti of Pakshaaghaata makes a mention of Siraa and Snaayu involvement by the vitiated Dosha_s According to Sus`hruta these are derived from the Naabhi originally in the intra uterine period. Originating from their traverse the whole body and provide nourishment and help drain the waste products. Rakta and Meda Dhaatu_s are the source from which they are formed. He also attributes very important functions to them in the smooth working of the body mechanism. E.g. they are the carriers of Vaata, Pitta, Kapha and Rakta in the body. He classifies them into four main categories Each of these performs a set of important functions. They are as under: - Vaatavaha Siraa: Are responsible for the co-coordinated voluntary activities of the body, they are responsible for cognition, analysis of the situation and effective execution of the decision taken by the higher centers. Thus transportation of all the incident stimuli to appropriate destination is the function of Vaatavaha Siraa in the body. Hence when they are affected by the vitiated Vaayu the result is Vaata disease characterized by dysfunction, abnormal movements, paralysis, sensory motor afflictions, loss of control over bowel/bladder etc. Pittavaha Siraa: These are responsible for maintaining body temperature, skin color and complexion, proper functioning of Agni and a state of general well being. Therefore when the vitiated Pitta harbors in them various Pitta predominant disorders result e.g. burning, discoloration, tingling and numbness, sweating, confusion etc. Kaphavaha Siraa: They are responsible for unctuousness, lubrication, and stability to body constituents and joints during movement, power and zeal. Therefore when vitiated Kapha affects these, the result is occlusion of the vessels, heaviness, loss of power, inertial, lethargy, paleness etc. Raktavaha Siraa: They are responsible for the fluid level of the tissues, skin color, and definite cognition of the tactile stimulus. Hence when the vitiated Rakta affects them they result in laxity of vessels, discoloration, ulcers, Parasthesia, loss of touch etc. From the foregoing discussion the role of Siraa_s in the pathogenesis and management should be clear. This is the unique contribution of Ayurveda to the understanding of Pakshavadha. Snaayu the second constituent of the Sampraapti of Pakshavadha is best described as ligaments and tendons. They perform the function of binding, holding together two parts. Thus imparting stability and power to movement is their prime function. Some authors have equated the peripheral nerves to the Snaayu_s. the Rakta and Meda as mentioned earlier like the Siraa_s form this. But the difference is in the degree of Kharataa. As Meda is a Sneha it cannot be completely dried out hence when the Agni and Vaayu interact with Meda and Rakta the result is a tough, tenacious structure that can withstand a large amount of push and pull and still remain intact. The peripheral nerves are also tough and are made of nerve fibers. They can if needed perform the binding of parts that they traverse. The ensuing laxity of the rotator cuff and the shoulder joint capsule results in Subluxation of the affected shoulder joint in a chronic Hemiplegic person. This condition seriously hampers the chances of recovery of upper extremity and especially the hand function. The vital role of Abhyanga in the management of Pakshavadha is a common experience. Sus`hruta classifies the Snaayu_s into four broad categories and describes their anatomical locations. Each performs some important functions. They are as under:- Pratanavat Snaayu: These are situated mainly in the extremities. Their function is to provide attachments to various muscles and help them in voluntary movements, to provide stability to the limb during various states. Vritta Snaayu: Is rounded tendons and ligaments. They are found in the back. They act as an anchor to the various postural muscles of the back Viz. Erector Spinae group of muscles. Prithu Snaayu: These are the flat tendons and ligaments. They are found in the region of the knee, elbow and the wrists. They have a short span and are mainly useful in imparting stability to the joint they cross. Sushira Snaayu: these are the sphincters situated in the stomach, rectum and the urinary bladder. Their function is to hold the contents of the respective organ till the process is complete by remaining closed during the process. At the end of the process they open and facilitate the passage of the contents in a controlled manner. Sus`hruta lays great emphasis on the proper knowledge of Snaayu_s. Since these last play an important role in the management of Pakshavadha. In the later stage of Pakshavadha the sub-Luxation of the shoulder joint occurs as a result of the laxity of the Snaayu_s there. When this takes place it results in a hampered hand function, immobility of the fingers. Hence it is a vital that in the initial stage only a triangular sheath is given to the patient with a round, firm support in the armpit, taking care to include the elbow in the sling. Tightness of the Snaayu_s at the hip and the knee result in the typical Hemiplegic gait i.e. walking with Circumduction of the lower extremity. It is commonly believed that the brain does not have a significant role to play in the Sampraapti of Pakshavadha. It is not true, as Charaka has clearly stated that the S`hiromarma harbors a specialized form of Majjaa called Mastulunga. This Mahaa Sneha is the final abode of the various Indriya_s and their Praan`a_s. the Tarpaka Kapha also resides there to nourish the Indriya_s. similarly to this effect Bhela Samhitaa has made some interesting observations in the Chikitsaa Sthaana and Sutra Sthaana too. He clearly states the diseases arising out of the vitiation of Asthi and Majjaa Dhaatu_s include Pakshagraha along with Apasmara (convulsive disorder), Unmaada (affective disorder), Bhanga (pain characterized by breaking), Kampana (tremors), Gaatra Shosha (wasting, atrophy of organs), Ardita (facial palsy), Kun`i (flexion Contracture at elbow), Kubja (Potts spine or Kyphosis due to collapsed vertebral bodies), Hanugraha (Temporo-Mandibular Subluxation), Paangulya (Paraplegia), Sandhi-Vichyuti (dislocations at various joints) and other Vaata Roga_s. even a casual look at the list would be sufficient to explain the meaning of the author. All these conditions are a result of the central nervous system disorder either traumatic or due to intrinsic factors. Similarly Charaka also enumerates a list of conditions as a result of the S`hiro Mahaa Marma that clearly throws light on the connection between the Mastulunga and the well being of the body-Indriya and mind complex. They are as follows: - Manyaa Stambha, Ardita, Chakshu Vibhrama, Moha, Udvesht`ana, Kaasa, S`hvaasa, Chesht`a Naas`ha Hanu Graha, Mookataa, Gadgada Vak, Akshi Nimeelana, Gan`d`a Spandana, Jrimbhaa, Laalaa Sraava, Svarahaani, Vadana Jihmatva along with others. In another place while describing the Shiro Roga due to vitiated Vaata, he enumerates a list of symptoms that clearly spell the CNS relation. Marma_s also have a critical role in the manifestation of Pakshavadha too. Injury to the Marma_s like Lohitaaksha, Kakshadhara directly results in Pakshavadha. Clinical Picture of Pakshavadha Acute stage: Is characterized by complete Akarman`ya i.e. Paralysis, which is flaccid in nature, loss of speech with or without drooping, loss of bowel, bladder control, and facial distortion. Sub acute stage: Flaccidity replaced by mild Spasticity, slurred speech, partial movements but un-coordinated in nature, some control over bowel and bladder. Chronic stage: Exhibit the following shoulder subluxation, flexion at the elbow, Pronated forearm, wrist and fingers in flexion, mild swelling over the fingers, slurred but coherent speech, extension of the lower extremity resulting in apparent lengthening, this gives rise to the typical Hemiplegic Circumductory gait, fully developed Spasticity and the movements of the upper extremity in either flexion or extension synergy pattern. Charaka gives a more or less similar account of the condition, which is as under: Involvement of either the right or the left half of the body, with or without half of the face; distortion of the nose, eyebrows, cheeks, skin folds, of the forehead, mouth which result in difficulty in chewing and swallowing. The eyes do not move in tune with speech. Choking of the nose resulting in arrested sneezing difficulties in speech like slowness, slurring, incoherent, weakness, and stuttering etc. looseness of teeth and inability to chew as well as partial to complete loss of hearing, hoarseness of voice. Pain in various parts like feet, hands, head, shins, ears etc. In the later stage due to the affliction of the Siraa, Snaayu, Kan`d`araa and Marma_s the involved parts become S`hushka i.e. dried out and wasted. This result in contractures of the extremities, stiffness at the joints, pain on attempted movement fixed facial expression like a grimace. Due to involvement of the Rakta and Meda Dhaatu_s and there by products like Siraa, Kan`d`araa, Snaayu and above all Majjaa and Marma_s the role of Snehana is very important. This is a fact, which every Ayurvedic physician knows only too well. The stage wise line of management that is followed by us is described below: If the person is present in the evolving state, the procedure routinely done is Rakta Mokshan`a i.e. blood letting by Venepuncture. The amount varies with the age and (Bala) strength of the patient but it is not less than 50 ml at a time. This immediately helps change the Dosha Gati and arrests the progress of the Vega further. The rationale for this is: - the vitiated disease creating Dosha_s circulate in the body through the medium of Rasa Rakta complex. When this contaminated complex is let out the stimulus results in alteration of the Dosha Gati and Sampraapti Bala is reduced considerably. This has shown considerable and consistent results in all of the cases treated so far. Age or gender was no bar for the treatment. In case the patient is Krisha or Apatarpita / Lean or emaciated we use:- Mahaa Yogaraaja Guggulu 500 mg and Raupya Taapyaadi Loha 250 mg in Praan`a and Vyaana Kaala twice a day along with freshly prepared Balaamoola and Maasha Kvaatha 60 ml In Udaana Kaala Eran`d`a Sneha 20 mls is given with Vishvaa and Shatapushpaa Kvaatha 60 ml. For Abhyanga and Nasya  Dhaanvantara Taila In the sub acute stage after about ten days Basti is commenced. Eran`d`a Moola and Das`ha Moola Nirooha Basti alternating with Balaa Taila Anuvaasana are given. The course is selected after evaluating the person. Care in the acute stage is taken to prevent (Amsa Sransa) or shoulder Subluxation from taking place. A triangular sling does this with a support to the armpit and the elbow is included in the sling. This way the arm is supported adequately and the wrist is spared from supporting the dead weight of the arm. In the chronic stage when the Stambha is marked and the effective movements are severely restricted, use of Lavan`a Sneha is important. Hence Mahaa Maasha Saindhava Taila is used. Similarly Lavan`a Po`t`alee Sveda is done after the Abhyanga. The Anuvaasana Basti is alternated with Yaapana Basti prepared from Balaa or Yashtimadhu and all the Sneha substances like ghee, Tila Taila, Madhu, Guda and Saindhava in a Ksheera Paaka base is administered. In cases characterized by Bhrama and S`hira S`hoola a Lepa of Arjuna and Aamalakee Kalka was applied to the Head in the afternoon (Pitta Kala) this immediately reduces Bhrama and Shira Shoola. In the long standing or Chirottha cases we administer various Yaapana Basti_s. Most commonly used is the Vrishya Yaapana consisting of: - In males, Balaa, Atibalaa, Apaamaarga Beeja, Yava, Yasht`imadhu Ksheerapaaka with Ghrita, Taila, Madhu, Gud`a (Jaggery) and Saindhava as Prakshepa. In case of female patients first Balaadi Yaapana of Charaka Siddhi 9 is given in the head lowered position. The time of administration is in the evening immediately after some food. We encourage retention of the Basti Dravya for as long a time as possible. The Yaapana Basti alternates with Anuvaasan Basti of Shuddha Balaa Taila and Saindhava. In Santarpita or Sthoola patients i.e. well-built or obese persons we use Ekaangaveer Rasa. The Sampraapti in these people is more of Srotorodha Pradhaana or more occluding in nature, along with Yogaraaja Guggulu. The reason is the contents of Ekaangaveera are mostly Malla derivatives. It is very powerful and Aama Paachana and Vaata S`haamaka in nature. It improves the formation of Rasa by causing Aama Paachana. This is combined with fresh Mahaa Raasnaadi Kvaatha 60 ml as Anupaana The Nirooha Basti is of Dashamoola and Madana Phala Kvaatha, alternating with Sahachara Taila Anuvaasana. For Abhyanga and Nasya, Sahacharaadi Taila is used. For Svedana Nirgun`d`ipatra, Baashpa Sveda is given. In the chronic stages, when the Stambha is marked Lavan`a and Nirgun`d`ipatra Pot`t`alee Sveda is administered. In case of S`hira S`hoola, a Lepa of Dhanvayaasa is applied to the Lalaat`a / forehead. In case of Gadgad Vaak Jihvaa Pratisaaran`a by Haridraa and Akaarakarabha (Akkalakaara) is followed by Tila Taila Gan`doosha are advised. In case the person is Balavaana and the disease is not responding to the conventional treatment, Rakta Moksha is done from the Siraa in the sub Mandibular region. This gives a very satisfactory result. As an adjuvant to the Chikitsaa a Sramsana or Anulomana is always prescribed at bedtime.

Note: - As the disease progresses the Dhaatu are substantively depleted and their wastes increase proportionately.

Chi. 4, S. U. 45, .H. Ni. 3, Chi. 2, N.R. Raktapitta Introduction: This is an acute disease (Aas`hukaaree). It spreads like forest fire. It should be treated immediately and carefully. When this disease changes the course (direction) it is indicative of incurability (Asaadhyatva). It is a serious disease (Mahaagada), having grave consequences. It afflicts the patient very fast. Mahaavega - greatly agitated). It is like fire and affects instantaneously (Agnivat S`heeghrakaaree) Pitta is associated with Rakta; hence it has a natural tendency to vitiate. This vitiated Pitta combines with Rakta and contaminates it. Pitta and Rakta have comparable smell and colour. Owing to this relationship in this Vyaadhi Pitta is addressed as Rakta. Saamanya Chikitsaa Raktapitta is of three types Oordhvaga which is Kaphaanubandhee and is Saadhya Adhoga which is Vaataanubandhee and Yaapya Tiryak which is Asaadhya. Note: - Pratimaarga (Viruddha) Maarga Haran`a (S`hodhana): Eliminating the causative, vitiated Dosha from the opposite direction of its manifestation is the key to management of Rakta Pitta. (For Oordhvaga Raktapitta Kashaaya and Tikta Rasa are criteria for S`hamana Dravya and Madhura Rasa is for Adhoga Raktapitta.) Oordhvaga Raktapitta: - The causative attributes are Snigdha and Ushn`a which vitiate the combination of Kapha and Pitta resulting in Oordhvaga Rakta Pitta. To eliminate from the opposite Maarga, Virechana is the modality of choice; which is the best S`hodhana for Pitta and for Kapha too. Hence Oordhvaga Rakta Pitta is Saadhya / Curable. Out of the three Rasa_s owing to Kapha involvement Madhura is contraindicated; which leaves Kashaaya and Tikta for S`hodhana which are abundantly available, thus the choice is wide, hence it is Saadhya. Adhoga Raktapitta: - Vamana is the modality of choice as per Pratimaarga Haran`atenet. The attributes are Rooks`ha and Ushn`a; which cause vitiation of Vaata and Pitta. The available taste for S`hodhana is only Madhura. The availability for Madhura Vamana dravya is limited as well as S`hamana with Madhura Rasa too is limited. Vamana is not a treatment of choice for Pitta as well as Vaata. This makes Adhoga Rakta Pitta Yaapya / incurable but controllable with diet and regimen. Tiryak Raktapitta: - When all three Dosha_s are simultaneously vitiated and are circulating in the blood stream, the manifestation is subcutaneous, which does not respond to either Vamana or Virechana as the Dosha_s are in the S`haakha Maarga, owing to the amount of the Dosha_s it becomes impossible to bring them in the Kosht`ha for elimination. There is limited number of drugs available to manage this condition. The patient may be Durbala due vitiation of all the three Dosha_s and Rakta, all of them being Pran`aayatana_s. All these factors taken together render the condition incurable. Aavasthika Chikitsaa Flow of treatment State of Upeks`haa (Na Aadau Stambhanam Arhati) initially ignore if the bleeding is not too much as arresting the bleed may lead to complications  S`hamanaarha (Garbhin`ee, Baala etc.) Langhana Oordhvaga  Peyaa, Yavaagoo Adhoga Tarpan`a  S`hodhanaarha (Bahu Dosha, Balavaan Rugn`a etc.) Oordhvaga  Virechana, Peyaa, Yavaagoo Adhoga  Vamana, Tarpan`a Oordhvaga Raktapitta: Kan`t`hagata Pichchha + Grathita Kalpa Naasaagata Astambhanaarha  Upeks`haa Ati Raktasraava  S`hamanaarha Stambhana  Avapeed`a Nasya (S`heeta Dravya) Adhoga Raktapitta: Yonigata  Pradaravat Chikitsaa Mootra Maarga Gata + Rujaa  Ksheerapaaka + Uttara Basti Gudagata Kalpa + Basti  Raktaatisaara Chikitsaa Raktaja Ars`ha Chikitsaa Vaata Ulban`a Avasthaa  Vibandha Maamsa Rasa Sevana Description: State of Upeks`haa Since Raktapitta is a bleeding disorder initially in person who is not weak and if only vitiated Dosha_s are flowing out, then no attempt should be made to arrest the bleeding as untimely arrest invariably leads to complications like Paan`d`u (anemia), Grahan`ee (Intestinal motility disorder), Kusht`ha (Resistant skin diseases), Prameha (Urinary tract and system disorders), Gulma (Solitary lump in abdomen) and Jvara (Pyrexia / fever) etc. S`hamanaarha Avasthaa If a person afflicted with bleeding disorder is exhibiting one or more of the following he should be subjected to palliative mode of treatment immediately without delay Should be treated by S`hamana Therapy.  By examining Langhanaarha and Brimhan`aarha, Tikta and Kashaaya Rasa substances should be used for S`hamana Therapy in Oordhvaga Raktapitta. Langhanaaraha persons should be administered Tikta (Bitter) and Kashaaya (Astringent) substance while Brimhan`eeya persons should be administered Madhura (Sweet) substances, in case sweet tasting substances is not available a substances having sweet post digestive taste (Madhura Vipaaka) should employed. Madhura Rasa substances should be used for Adhoga Raktapitta. Vaasaa is the S`hamana drug of choice in Rakta Pitta. The state of Upekshaa is assisted by Langhana (Fasting which could be complete fasting to restricted food intake in the form of Tarpan`a). By examining the Dosha_s (Dominant Dosha), Avasthaa (Oordhvaga or Adhoga or Tiryak), Saatmya (homologation) and Anubandha (associated Dosha) fasting should be done by consuming Tarpan`a. If Raktapitta is Oordhvaga, fasting is assisted by consuming Tarpan`a and if it is Adhoga fasting is done with consuming Peyaa, Yavaagoo etc. to control Vaata. After adequate fasting Sus`hruta advises the person to consume Peyaa with a little rice. The Rasa and Yoosha prepared by using Aromatic drugs and Sneha (oil or Ghee) are also suggested. Tarpan`a, Paachana, Avaleha and medicated ghee are also advised as per the condition and indication. The monitoring and protection of the persons physical power and mental strength is emphasized by Vagbhat`a throughout the management. A person suffering from Raktapitta exhibits aggravated Dosha_s, good strength and power, without muscular wasting and whose condition has arisen out of Santarpan`a, who can withstand S`hodhana and is devoid of complications should always be treated by S`hodhana. In a strong person suffering from Oordhvaga Raktapitta after Purification the sequence of food should consuming Tarpan`a and in case of Adhoga Raktapitta it should consist of Peyaa, Yavagoo etc. to establish control over Vaata activity. If the person suffers from Mandaagni and likes sour things to eat he should be given Tarpan`a prepared with sour substance which is not only harmless but also beneficial to him. The S`hritas`heeta Jala medicated with Tikta (bitter) drugs as well as fruit juices are suggested for Trishn`aa. By examining Dosha_s, Bala (Physical capacity) and Aahaara (food consumption) water can be given in small quantity and at small time intervals in Trishn`aa. In this condition clotting of blood occurs. Due to intermittent bleeding clots are seen in excreted blood. Excreta of pigeon (Paaraavata S`hakrit) mixed with appropriate Anupaana is used as medicine. Ati Nihsrita Rakta / Ati Raktasraava: - This condition can happen in any type of Raktapitta due to extremely aggravated intensity and heat of both Rakta and Pitta. In this condition medicine in the form of medicated Ghee as well as fresh blood with honey is advised to be taken internally. Udeern`a Raktapitta: - This is an acute disease and affects instantaneously like fire in terms of spread, causing damage and acuteness. The decoction of Rakta Stambhaka drugs should be used to treat Udeern`a Raktapitta. Note: - The above given conditions can occur irrespective of the type and Dosha Praadhaanya. The following are the conditions which occur in any of the type of Raktapitta. Oordhvaga Raktapitta: Oordhvaga Raktapitta is Saadhya type of Raktapitta. It is Kaphaanubandhi. Oordhvaga Raktapitta: Kaphaanubandha + Sapichchha + Grathita Rakta: - In this condition bleeding occurs from throat. The expectorated blood is found to be sticky due to mucous strands (Sa Pichchha), and along with clots (Grathita Rakta). Ks`haara is used in this condition though they are normally contraindicated. Ks`haara of Kamalanaala is used in this condition. Avapeed`a Nasya of Raktapitta Naas`haka drugs is the procedure of choice. This is given only when vitiated Dosha_s are excreted. To combat the effects of excessive bleeding use of fresh blood internally is advised as well as fresh goats liver is also advised to be consumed. Cold and Sweet substances should be used to treat Naasaagata Raktapitta. Threat in treating Naasaagata Raktapitta If bleeding is arrested when blood is still vitiated it produces Dusht`a Pratis`hyaaya, S`hiroroga, the smell of blood coming out from the nose resembles Pus or foul smell, power of smelling gets diminished / perception of smell is affected and Dusht`a Krimi appears in nose / the nose may exhibit presence of worm infestation in the later stages. Guidelines for Oordhvaga Raktapitta (which doesnt get pacified): Even after improved Agni, annihilation of Kapha, if bleeding persists then it is considered to be due to Vaata. Hence the management should aim at establishing normal flow of Vaata along its channels (Vaataanulomana).Vaataghna treatment should be done and Ksheerapaaka is the drug of choice for such condition. Adhoga Raktapitta: - This is Yaapya (remains controlled as long as the treatment is going on  palliative) type of Raktapitta. In this Vaata is Anubandhi / associated Dosha. In this type bleeding occurs from Mootra Maarga (Urethra), Guda (per rectum), and Yoni (per vaginum) in females. This should be differentiated from Raktaatisaara, Raktaja Ars`ha, Rakta Pradara like disorders resembling Adhoga Raktapitta. Vibandha is a condition found in Vaata Pradhaana Raktapitta in which MaamsaRasa is the medicine of choice. Ks`heerapaaka is the drug of choice according to Charaka and Vaagbhat`a. Sus`hruta suggests Uttarabasti for managing this condition. Since the sign and symptoms are similar to Raktaatisaara and Raktaja Ars`ha, their treatment also shows similarity. According to Sus`hruta it should be treated by the medicines used in Raktaatisaara. In Raktasraavee Ars`ha treatment of Raktapitta can be used and vise versa. Vaagbhat`a adds Basti as the procedure of choice for this condition Similar Chikitsaa: - Wholesome things for the person suffering from Raktapitta: - All Kashaaya and substances which are cold to touch and in potency are useful for treating Raktapitta in both ways i.e., internal as well as external.

Every one is ready and eager to put some additional input to achieve more efficacious components. The body by receipt of average usual intakes, manufactures, with the help of usual digestive capacities, usual tissues. Constraints however, in the form of illnesses, more fitness demanding jobs, pregnancy, delivery, infant nursing, accidents (tissue loss) natural or early time ageing makes it obligatory to have more capable tissues than usual. With better capable tissue it is possible to combat disease, ageing etc. Therefore there should be, some method by which the existing tissue generation can be strengthened. Even though one has no illness, if a strengthening method is available the chances of ageing, degenerative effects could be deferred or averted. With illness the useful tissues are rendered defunct or weak and therefore it is much advantageous to have a method of tissue regeneration or simply, rejuvenation. Since the environmental intake material, after intricate process of conversions, reaches various locations in the body, through the flux of Rasadhaatu, Ayurveda has named such process therefore Rasa-ayana. Here the Ayana Sanskrit word is for passage. So, if at all, it is desired to coin a transliterated word for Rasaayana it can be appropriately called seropassage. The body is utilizing the entire channel of Rasadhaatu to achieve efficacious tissues by certain specific factors. They are: Identifying interventive material that can have potential to create more efficacious cells, organs and systems. Since the body constitution demands, choice should be made, from available interventive material; of interventive that will counter-match the constitutional Dosha dominance. It also should have facilitation by homologous environmental factors too. If, Dosha dominant illness is in the background, that also needs to be thought of in counter-matching Appropriate method for processing the chosen interventive material with minute details regarding dose, frequency environment of the patient is to be maintained for achieving the maximum efficiency. So the entire seropassage programme is based on interventive that will counter-match Dosha dominance of healthy or diseased persons, opting a chosen process. As Ayurveda is being applied for healthdisease managements, in a number of places other than its origin, it is necessary to have an idea about what makes a substance, a potential seropassage. The average crop foods have to be protected from attacks by pests and insects. But there may be certain species that naturally do not succumb to the attacks of pests and insects. The plant material, which is digestible and absorbable, will imbibe the character of being resistant to the attacks of microbes etc. So the natural plants that have the capacity to withstand adversities in the form of extreme heat, cold, damp, dryness and survive to complete their plant life functions, are also useful. Extremes of heat etc. cause whole scale diseases or debilities. The cells of the plants surviving in such environmental hostility will give the similar character to beings if appropriately digested and absorbed. Aloe Vera is one good example. The creeper Tinospora cordifolia is nourished, even though it has no contact with soil and water. Probably it has the capacity to utilize material from the air. The Tinospora cordifolia creeper is used for improvising tissues. One has to find and list similar plants available at various places in the world. Natural over-ripening, decaying, degeneration is seen in many average eatables. The period required to achieve flowering, fruition, maturity may be longer. The stems also have a long span of sustenance. All they are exhibiting the capacity of cells of the plants to last longer than others. The swintemblica fruit appears after a longer maturity period of 13 to 14 years. The fruit if not hurt, does not get putrefied but breaks in six parts and dries. Here the capability to avoid over-ripening and putrefaction is exhibited by this fruit. So the quality of lasting, can be transferred to the cells of human beings, provided absorbable bulk of such fruit is consumed. The fruits with sweet soar taste are very prone to decompose but the one of Swintemblica terminalia show a lasting capacity instead of decomposing. Such, herbal, mineral, biological materials are distinctively compared and chosen as useful interventive materials for making tissue, more efficacious. A natural leaf-crush catches fungus, and gets decomposed within a stipulated time. But if the same is crushed along-with little traces of mercury the contact makes the otherwise decomposable, lasting. So if the appropriate absorbable fraction of mercury can reach in the system, it can imbibe the quality of lasting to existing decomposable tissues. Usually solids are heavier. But mercury has got a non-touching liquid form and still it is the heaviest. Such excellence is also to be looked upon; so that it can be used for improving the lasting capacity of associated ingredients. Plants or animals, which have tissue distinction in development, are more useful than less evolved ones. The seeds represent progeny material of the plant. So plants, vegetables with flower, fruits, seeds are considered more useful. If the animal or plant has more eliminable material than absorbable, the value is less as interventive for seropassage. More excretables only increase the work of digestion, but do not increase the chance of absorption for raw material for tissues. Animals, which have a larger quantity of eliminable substances, like sheep, camel, ass, have been discarded even as adjuvant during Rasaayana. Beans, Soya has a larger bulk of eliminable than green gram. So the advocating is done accordingly. The things that are easy to digest and absorb are considered more useful. Gold keeps on its glitter even though repeatedly exposed to fire. Other metals polished and subjected to fire do not regain the glitter unless once again polished. So gold has got a specific capacity to help complexion if properly taken. So to be interventive material it has to have the capacity to overcome the wrath of threatening contacts, imbibe long lasting property, avert putrefaction, over ripening etc. It has to have some beneficial quality of excellence in comparison with others in-group. Better absorbability to contribute to the tissues and minimal waste components are also necessary to achieve efficacy. There are many such herbal, mineral, biological materials. If one carefully looks at people, they are happy and comfortable with different / distinct / contra-distinct stimuli. To a healthy person milk is a troubleshooter, whereas one is happy with many Bengal gram preparations. The host, on whom the seropassage programme is to be conducted, may be of distinction because of the dominance of Kapha-Pitta or Vaata. The interventive material and auxiliary materials therefore, should be to compensate the dominance of Dosha. It should not contribute to the dominance of Dosha to initiate new imbalance and pathology. Therefore the method of studying the host or recipients factors and characters of interventive material is of prime application. If this exercise is not properly conducted the useful interventive material may trigger disease process. So the professional should be careful to counter-match the multiple factors, before deciding the interventive to be used in a specific host. By considering the multi-factors on either, i.e. recipient hosts and that of material; chances of aggravation are minimized. At times costly interventive materials have to be discarded. So the Dosha dominance of individual, the Dosha dominance of disease pathology, the character of habitat and that of season are to be considered. The equatorial and polar climates have distinction of dominant hotness and coolness. So the interventive material should have characters to compensate the dominance arising out of the habitat. It is a factor non-monitored and therefore to be compensated by appropriate character dominance, through intervention material, and its process and proportion (dose). The season usually chosen should be promoting digestive power so that the food consumed can be better used. The capacity of the host and strength of the interventive is also to be considered. A lean weak person may not tolerate a strong interventive because of weakness of the entire recipient system. Age too has got a bearing on Dosha_s. Up to 18-20 years it is dominance of Kapha but later on it will not be so. After 55-60 dominance of Vaata is there. A substance is likely to give rise to hard stools by much absorption and may spell trouble for some simply because of the context of age. The reader may be knowing the characters of Glycerriza glabra, Vithania somnifera or Anacardum nut. None has comparable similarity to other two. But each one by itself is useful as seropassage material. Pitta dominant and similar hot side host factors will be palliated by Glyceriza glabra. Kapha dominance, cool side host factors can comfortably be taken care of by Anacardum, Vaata can be balanced by Vithania somnifera. So it is the counter matching, beneficial to curb the dominance; arising out of constitution, pathology, habitat, season etc. that helps to achieve results. The interventive materials from mineral or biological source need be considered similarly. Counter matching for Dosha and taking advantage of season facility is the key in choosing one or few of the many interventives, available. This factor when not comprehended puzzles the reader. Anything for everything and nothing is certain; is the wrong reaction; which is to be mended in time. Having considered criteria and counter matching multiplicity, the reader can proceed to an understanding of the processes. The desires to achieve, endowed, better efficient tissues, are to be achieved by processing the chosen interventive material. After the process for the benefit of better seropassage, the dose and frequency is to be decided. To achieve maximal beneficial effects Ayurveda considers not only the substance, counter matching but expects the entire environment of the patient to be conducive for tissue endowment. The interventive material is processed in such a way that the concentration of beneficial component is higher. swintemblica fruits that are cooked are rendered devoid of the hard seeds. This is done to increase the full absorption. Even the fibrous material in the pulp of fruit is separated. This is done with the intention, that useful / beneficial material should not be associated with excretable material. The components that are not likely to be absorbed after the complete work of digestion are separated earlier only. The work of digestion is not even fractionally wasted. Maximum digestible and absorbable components are brought together. To any and every seropassage interventive, few medicines that will invigorate the digestive capacity are added. Usually they are ginger and two pepper (corns). The invigoration of Agni-digestive capacity  can boost the entire initial process. The vegetable fat, oils or biological fat, clarified butter  ghee, substances that will mildly promote movement of digestive tract, and secretions in it, are appropriately added and thoroughly mixed. In average processing, care is taken for easily digestible absorbable components enrichment along with mild invigorators, secretogogue and smooth movement promoters. This ensures that after entry the interventive is properly absorbed. In special situations Ayurvedic scientists have made attempts to utilize specific capacities naturally available. Swintemblica fruits are to be cooked in the hollow of a tree Tectona glandis (teak). The stem of the tree builds itself up in decades and gets stronger and wider. If cut; it has the capacity to last un-decayed for a century. If later on converted in to furniture that furniture also lasts for further century without being attacked by decomposing microbes or pests or insects. The idea of cooking swintemblica in the hollow of such a tree is that the sap of the plant will enter in the fruits when being cooked. The cell of the plant has got a specific lasting character. But the plant component or products are not absorbable. The sap, that enters in the swintemblica fruits by cooking; will carry the quality to the consumer/customer. Such cooked fruits pulp is advised for consumption, to ones full capacity. In preparation of certain seropassage interventives, utensils for process are to be carved from the stem of trees. Such moist carved utensils are to be used for only one time process; and then discarded. Here the heat contact of the inside material, is established through the moist fresh  wood. Naturally the ingredients that leave the wood, at a particular temperature have the chance, to mix with under process interventive material. At times particular leaves are to be given to cow as feed. They are the leaves of medicinal plants. The milk of such a cow is to be utilized for providing ghee as combination material for the intervention. The process like boiling, curdling, clarifying butter is taken advantage of according to specific observations. It is an attempt to achieve distinct beneficial components by natural observations application. Especially minerals are heated and after trituration dried in a variety of herbal juices. Such repetitions are continued till the shining and hardness are modified and followed. The chances of the otherwise hard mineral, likely to be digested and possibly absorbed, are much increased by such processes. Average herbal material is used by the simple process of getting the juice also. So the interventive materials are processed with specific intention that they should reach in. Having prepared the interventive materials, they are administered in different doses and frequencies. A single specific dose with rich nourishment by auxiliary nutritive (usually ghee, sugar, milk, etc.) is administered on an empty stomach and no other intake for 30, 45 minutes is one of the simple methods. It assures digestion absorption in a better way. Having given the first dose, subsequent increase of doses, to reach a maximum; and tapering down the dose later for a similar period, is another method. It is for achieving more and more titre of seropassage intervention by progressively acclimatizing the system. With increase in dose the span of no-food or drink is proportionately increased. At times a 2- hour span is allowed for digestion absorption of interventive herbal material in a dose of 16-20 gms at a time. This method with herbals or herbo-minerals brings resistance and builds, better organs and systems. Another very special method of administration of seropassage intervention is avoiding all other stimuli to work on the individual. This is by captivating the individual restricted in specially structured residence under supervision. The individual under regimen does not reach to the outside people etc. but psychologically also thinks of improvement of the entire body all the 24 hours for a stipulated period. Every facility that is necessary for improvement is provided under professional supervision. He has to be in the environment specially created for achieving the target. Technically it is termed as Kut`ipraaves`hika method or the method of restricting any other stimuli from coming in contact with the privileged person. It may be noted that the process of seropassage; pre-requires purification by emesis purgation, intrarectals etc. to prepare the absorption passage more sensitive and ready to absorb the digested interventive Rasaayana material. Without preparation, it is aptly exemplified, that the best color material and technical expertise can show the results; on prepared surface; and not on dirty, greased rough surface. One cannot anticipate results. Rasaayana, the attempt to endow tissues, is therefore considered by Ayurveda in a most exhaustive comprehensive style.

Concept of Agni: Agni is the energy required for any transformation and all physiological processes. Health and diseases are results of normal and vitiated Agni respectively. Agni regulates all life processes also its vitiation can lead to any kind of disease. Normal functions of Agni: Ayu (Chetanaavriti), Varn`a, Bala, Svaasthya, Utsaaha, Upachaya, Prabhaa Bhuddhi Kaanti, Praan`a, Oja, Teja are dependent on normal Agni (Prabalatva). Types of Agni: According to functions According to functions there are thirteen types of Agni. Those are Jat`haraagni, 7 Dhaatvagni and 5 Bhootaagni. Jaat`haraagni: Among all types, Jaatharaagi is most important and responsible for conversion of food (which is nutritive to Shaarira, Dhaatu Ojas Bala and Varn`a) to Apakva Ahaara rasa further in to Pakva Ahaara rasa, which is further transformed into Rakataadi Dhaatu. Dhaatvaagni: Seven Dhaatvaagni is situated in the respective Dhaatus which on digestion and conversion get altered into further Dhaatus producing Saara (essence) and Kit`t`a (desecrate) Part. E.g. Rasa Dhaatvaagni converts Rasa Dhaatu in to Prasaada bhoota Uttara Dhaatu i.e. Rakta and Updhaatu i.e. Stanya and during this process the Kit`t`a / mala part produced as Kapha. Bhootagni: These Bhootaagni are five Paarthiva, Aapya, Taijas, Vaayaveeya and Naabhasa. Ahaara, which is Pancha Bhauatika; digested by these respective Agni, which further provide nutrition to the body. Thus Bhootaagni transforms the As`haarira Mahaabhoota (external Mahaabhoota) to S`haarira Mahaabhoota. E.g. - When we drink (water) the water is transformed by Jala Mahabhootaagni to the S`haarir Jala. Thus, Bhootaagni are responsible for the processing of the five basic elements into a composition useful to the body. Agnimaandya is the causative factor of most of the diseases. According to type of vitiation, Agni is of four types. They are as follows: Teekshn`a (penetrating) Due to its intense attribute it can digest food matter in (Quantity wise) Maatra guru, (Quality wise) Guru Dravya, Viruddha Anna, Vishama Anna. Also at the end of digestion it causes Gala Taalu Osht`ha S`hosha, Daaha Santaapa. It is found in Pitta pradhaana Prakriti or due to influence of Pitta Dosha on Jaatharagni. This condition when gets more aggravated it is called Bhasmaka / Atyagni. This is a disease caused due to the hyperactivity of the digestive capacity (Teekshn`aagni). After having food, a person gets relief and after the digestion gets irritated. Due to Teekshn`aagni the digestion is very fast. Sampraapti of Teekshn`aagni: When aggravated Pitta gets associated with Vaayu, in a Kapha depleted condition; with the help of scorching attribute, Agni empowers Pitta. This Pita is strengthened leading to augmentation of Agni. This increased Agni digests food quickly, digests, and if not supplied by food, absorbs normal Dhaatu. It leads to the weakness and death. Manda (Mild): The properties are exact opposite to Teekshn`aagni. It cannot digest even adequate amount of food and causes the Vidaaha. This Vidagdha Ahaara is expelled out of body causing vomiting or diarrhoea. Mandaagni causes Udara Gaurava, Kaasa, S`hvaasa, Gaatra Sadana and any disease. It is found in Kaphapradhaana Prakriti or caused due to influence of Kapha Dosha on Jaatharagni. Sama (Normal): It remains normal only when Pathyaaahaara and Vihaaara is observed by an individual and gets altered with Mithyaaahaara and Vihaaara. It causes Dhaatu saamya when adequate amount of diet is consumed. It is found in Sama Prakriti. Vishama (Unequal): The properties are exact antagonistic to Samaagni. It causes Dhaatuvaishamya. It sometimes digests food adequately or some time may cause disorders like Aadhmaana, S`hoola, Udaavarta, Udara Gaurava, Antrakoojana Pravahan`a. It is found in Vaatapradhaana Prakriti. This is caused due to Samaana Vaayu Vaigun`ya. Agni and Dosha: Agni is associated with Pitta Dosha that is responsible for following actions occurring in body. Agni is always associated with Pitta. The five types of Pitta are also termed as Paachakaagni, Braajakaagni, Saadhakaagni, Ranjakaagni and Aalochakaagni. Praan`a and Apaana vaayu are responsible for Dhmaapana of Agni. Samaana vaayu is responsible for maintenance of Agni. Agni and Ritu Sambandha:- Greeshma is Agni dominant. Jaat`haaragni status with relation to Ritu Agni Sthaana :- Pitta Dosha, Grahan`ee and Naabhi are seat of Agni. Grahan`ee: Grahan`ee is Agni Adhist`haana it is also called Pittadharaa Kalaa, which withholds and assimilates all types of food (As`hita, Khaadita, Peeta, Leed`ha) so is called Grahan`i, When Agni is Manda The food without digestion passes through Annavaha Srotas. Paachaka Pitta: - Paachaka Pitta that resides in mid portion of Pakvas`haya and Aamaas`haya. Though being Paanchabhauteeka it is predominantly Agni Gun`a Pradhaana leaves its liquid state and becomes Kat`hina and is responsible for digestion. This Paachakaagni segregates the digested food into Saara and Kit`t`a and provides strength to Saadhakaadi Types of Pitta. In addition, if Paachakaagni is increased, all the other Agni gets stimulated and if it is decreased, all the other Agni is depleted. Diseases and Agni: Mandaagni causes most of the diseases (Udara etc.) some of such diseases are classified as example. Agni Chikitsaa Reference: C.Su.1,12, Chi13,15,Vi.5, A.H.Su.9, 12, Chi10, S. Su.21, 35 Saamaanya Chikitsaa: Maintenance of normal Agni is aimed in all health and treatment guidelines; hence Kaaya Chikitsaa is Antaragni Chikitsaa.

Su.15, A.H.11 Introduction: The term Dhaatu means body constituents. The word Dhaatu is derived from the verb Dhri that means to support. They sustain the life process and support the body too. Rasa, Rakta, Maamsa, Meda, Asthi, Majja and S`hukra are the seven Dhaatu. They should be in normal state. Increased (Vriddha) or depleted (Ksheen`a) cause diseases or weakness of respective organs or tissues. (Sthaanavaigun`ya) Rasa Dhaatu: Rasa means one which moves or circulates continuously. It is derived from food. The essence or useful part of food after digestion becomes Rasa. It is responsible for health, complexion and feeling of contentment (Preen`ana), satisfaction or satiety. The vitiation of Rasa gives rise to reluctance to carry out normal activities, anorexia, nausea, weak digestive power, fever, restlessness, emaciation and dryness and wrinkling of skin, premature greying of hair.

Indriya Upaghaata is incurable, but the physician should treat any disease related to Indriya with following guidelines. Saamanya Chikitsaa: Diagnosis to assess status of Indriya and related organ (Indriya Adhisht`haana) is very important. If related organ has disease, that should be treated accordingly. e.g. If Baadheerya is symptom due to Karn`aars`ha, main disease should be treated. Differential diagnosis should be thought prior to treatment considering Indriya related signs and symptoms. e.g. Indriya Daurbalya appears as symptom of Paan`d`u and Kaamalaa If Indriya Dusht`ee is complication (Upadrava) of some other disease, that disease should be managed with Indriya specific treatment. e.g. Indriyoparodha is Upadrava of Gara Visha. Treatment should be Vishaghna and Indriya Bala Vardhaka Indriya Naas`ha (complete damage) should be considered as Arisht`a (sign of grave prognosis). Panchakarma treatment has key role in Indriya related disorders. As its effects are Indriya Balavardhana (strengthening Indriya). Treatment for head (e.g. Nasya, S`hirobasti, S`hirodhara etc) should be suggested as it is seat of all Indriya.

Ayurveda has mentioned the psycho-somatic nature of disease. A number of factors in the present era affect the functions of mind causing the unnecessary deviation in the functional attributes of mind showing different signs and symptoms. This results in either psychological disorder or psychosomatic disease. Many of the times these signs and symptoms remain in dormant phase and suddenly even with minute stimulus results in hazardous disease. Some of the effects on Mana could be stages in pathogenesis or Hetu for some diseases. (e.g. Bhaya for Bhayaja Atisaara) Saamanya Chikitsaa: Such diseases are covered under disorders like Unmaada, Apasmaara, Atatvaabhinivesha, Graha Roga etc. Dhi, Dhairya and Aatma Vidnyaana are remedies for psychological disorders. It includes proper reasoning and intellect, decision process and knowledge about self. Charaka has described following treatment for Mana. Dnyaana (knowledge of supreme spirit or self) Vidnyaana (philosophical knowlege) Dhyaana (meditation) Smriti (memory) Samaadhi (control of mind by freeing from all objects of senses) All these aspects are grouped in the term Satvaavajaya, which means control of mind by giving up unwholesome contact to objects of senses. Treatment of psychological diseases should be given considering Hetu, relation to other factors as Dosha, Dhaatu, Indriya, Vyaadhi Svabhaava, Vyaadhi Avasthaa etc. Some of the principles are highlighted as examples. Some diseases should be treated considering causative factors (Hetu Vipareeta Chikitsaa). For example, Bhayaja Atisaara should be treated by Aas`hvaasana, Harshan`a and Mana Prasaadana along with other treatment. Some diseases require immediate counselling (Aas`hvaasana) to boost morale of patient otherwise depressed attitude (Vishaada) can lead to further aggravation.

Ojas is an entity which provides the site to harbor the Praan`a. It is said to be one of the Praan`aayatana. Ojas gets nourishment after digestion of food. Ultimately, maintenance of Ojas is dependent on Ojas nourishing food and its proper digestion. Even if the food is having good nourishing qualities but not lacking in digestive energy (Jaat`haraagni), then also vitiation in the Ojas can be seen. Ojas has very close relation with Hridaya, Manas, Indriya (especially Sense Organs i. e. Dnyaanendriyaan`i), all 7 Dhaatu (especially Rasa and S`hukra Dhaatu) and the Chaitanya Sangraha. It is essence of all Dhaatu from Rasa to S`hukra. It is Saarabhaaga (ultimate essence) of all the Dhaatu; also it is described as Mala or Upadhaatu of S`hukra. Thus, it is the purest and ultimate entity, which is responsible to hold the Praan`a. Rasa Dhaatu is also named as Ojas. Sus`hrutaachaarya has designated the strength of body to Ojas considering all these qualities. It is called as Bala. Properties of Ojas Somaatmaka (nourished by the moonlight) Snigdha (unctuous) S`hukla (bright colored) S`heeta (cold in nature) Sthira (steady by its qualitative and quantitative aspect. It does not get easily vitiated unless and until there is strong and long lasting Sampraapti or Hetu Sevana to disturb its normal physiology; therefore any vitiation in the Ojas needs to be given proper attention so as to put it in its normal status) Sara (moving and liquid in nature) Vivikta (solitary entity though it is an ultimate essence of all Dhaatu) Mridu (soft in nature) Mritsna (bright lustrous Chakahakaayamaana) Madhura Svabhaavee (sweet in taste) Functions of Ojas Sthira Upachita Maamsataa (balanced muscular growth). Sarva Chesht`aasu Apratighaatah (mental and physical power to carry out any task without getting defeated by the obstacles). Svara Varn`a Prasaadah (Deep commanding voice and glorious skin luster). Karan`aanaam Aatma Kaarya Pratipattih (proper and utmost efficiency in the sense and action organs i.e. Dnyaanendriya an`i and Karmendriyaan`i. Signs of Ojas Attributes of Ojas are seen in Kapha Prakriti. Those person are Ojasvee, S`haanta (calm and cool), Aayushmanta (having longer life). Aindra Sattva person have presence of all the attributes of Ojas, hence called as Ojasvee. A person having equal Aayaaama and Vistaara, is said to be Ojasvee. Any qualitative enrichment in the Ojas can be inferred by the signs and symptoms observed on Hridaya, Manas, Indriya and all Dhaatu. Types of Ojas: Ayurveda explains two types of Ojas: Para Ojas and Apara Ojas. Para Ojas: The quantity of Para Ojas is 8 Bindu. It resides in the Hridaya. It is highly pure (without any waste ingredient S`huddha). It is red in colour with yellow tinge (Raktam Ishat Sapeetakam). This Para Ojas is responsible for continuation of life; therefore it is called as Praanaas`hraya Ojas. Whenever, there is depletion of this Para (Great) Ojas, it is the indication of death which reflects in form of Arisht`a Lakshn`a described in Indriyasthaana of Charaka Samhitaa. Therefore, one can infer that unless and until there is vitiation of Para Ojas, the Arisht`a Lakshan`a can not be manifested. Apara Ojas: Whereas, Apara Ojas is Anjalee in quantity and resides in the Hridaya and Hridayastha 10 Dhamanee. All these Dhamanee carries Ojas which is having qualities same as Rasa (Rasaatmaka). Whenever there is vitiation in Apara Ojas, it is treatable and curable; but as explained earlier vitiation in Para Ojas is a sign for death which reflects in terms of Arisht`a. Ojovikriti The vitiation in this Apara Ojas happens in three ways: Ojas Kshaya (decrease in terms of quantity) Ojas Visramsa (falling asunder, dropping down, relaxation, weakness of Ojas) Ojas Vyaapad (derangement in terms of quality of Ojas) (Ojas - Kshaya, Visramsa and Vyaapad are also termed as Bala - Kshaya, Visramsa and Vyaapad respectively as Ojas is also considered as Bala.) Causative factors for Oja Kshaya and Ojo Visramsa Abhighaata (trauma) Kshaya (depletion in body tissues) Kopa (anger) Dhyaana (mental representation at one subject) S`hrama (exertion) Kshudhaa (hunger) Ativyavaaya Anas`hana S`hoka In the 8 th month of pregnancy, Sthira Gun`a of Ojas is not established completely; therefore it is moving from baby to mother and mother to baby; so this is not the proper month for delivery. If Ojas resides in mother, then mother remains fresh and vice versa.

Sha.9 Introduction: All the changes and transformations invariably take place in the Srotas (different channels) in the human body. Srotas should be maintained properly to maintain healthy status. Whenever any vitiation occurs in the Srotas, they affect respective process that is taking place in that particular Srotas. Hence consideration of Srotas concept is necessary in treatment of any disease. Concept of Srotas: Srotas is channel, which carries any transformable material. In this space, the form of material gets converted into absorbable form. For example, consumed food gets converted in to Aahaara Rasa and Mala in Annavaha Srotas. Many Srotas are interlinked to each other. Some Srotas accept Bhaava Padaartha (matter) from the universe; some Srotas process them and at the end some Srotas eliminate the waste products which are formed from these metabolic processes. Annavaha Srotas, Praan`avaha Srotas, Udakavaha Srotas accept food, Praan`a (Ambarapeeyusha), water respectively. Whereas Rasavaha to S`hukravaha Srotas process the accepted matter and convert them in to S`haareera Bhaava (attributes of human body). This is the process of nourishment of all the Dhaatu, Indriya, Praan`a etc. Mootravaha, Pureeshavaha, Svedavaha Srotas  These Srotas throws out the excreta created by the metabolic processes. If there is any structural or functional vitiation of this Srotas, then processes get affected, which in turn affects the further metabolic processes leading to diseases or local pathology. Srotas related pathologies (Sroto Dusht`i) can be grouped in four types: Atipravritti (extra manifestation) Sanga (obstruction) Siraa Granthi (glandular growth) Vimaargamana (movement through other Srotas) Sus`hrutaachaarya has mentioned pairs of 11 Srotas and he has not mentioned Asthivaha, Svedavaha, Majjaavaha Srotas but mentioned Aartavavaha Srotas which is not mentioned by Charaka.

Some of the signs and symptoms are very prominent and hence treated as major diseases but some remain dormant and at times participate as one of the factors of Sampraapti Process. Saamaanya Chikitsaa While treating these diseases it is advisable to administer all the therapies indicated for vitiation of respective Dhaatu also. E.g. for Stanya Dusht`i the Saamaanya Chikitsaa of Rasapradoshaja Vyaadhi should also be administered along the other line of treatment. Vis`hesha Chikitsaa The child should also be treated in same way but following some precautions. The treatment of diseases for children should be done similar to adults but the medicines should be mild.

As per constricted lumen of the penis, appropriate dilator should be chosen and skill fully inserted in to opening of penis; simultaneously Vaatagna Taila should be poured over penis. This procedure should be repeated after three days with gradually increasing size of dilators. It helps to reduce the constricted foreskin.

U. 41/34-60, C. Chi. 8, A. H. Chi. 5  Introduction According to Sus`hruta, S`hosha is a disease which is of high severity and is difficult to diagnose and eliminate. Before manifesting it is preceded by many diseases and after manifestation many diseases follow it. Definition It is known as S`hosha because it dries up Rasa etc. Dhaatu. It also reduces various functions in the body and hence called as Kshaya. Other people call it as Raajayakshmaa as this disease affected the Moon  the king of celestial bodies and constellations (Naks`hatra). Vaagbhat`a however interprets that as it is the king (chief) of diseases so it is known as Raajayakshmaa. This disease wants attention equivalent to a king hence the name Raajayakshmaa Types of S`hosha (According to Sus`hruta) Types of Raajayakshmaa (according to Charaka and Vaagabhat`a) Saahasaja Raajayakshmaa Sandhaaran`aja Raajayakshmaa Kshayaja Raajayakshmaa Vishamaas`hanaja Raajayakshmaa According to Sus`hruta, in all the seven types of S`hosha, all the symptoms of Raajayakshmaa caused by three Dosha do not reflect hence these should be treated as Kshaya due to wasting of Dhaatu (Dhaatukshaya) Even though these seven categories show some commonality with Raajayakshamaa wasting of some Dhaatu; they differ in some aspects. Hence, Sus`hruta prefers to describe them as S`hosha.

Avapeed`a Nasya is also advised (Choorn`a + Sarshapa Taila). The same Choorn`a are used for application to the nose. In all kinds of Unmaada the patient should be cheered. In the initial phase patient should be given S`hamana after mild S`hodhana (S.U.62/34-35). Vaataja Unmaada: In Vaataja Unmaada the first line of treatment should be Snehapaana. In this type, physician should ascertain the nature of Vaayu, based on that Sneha should be administered i.e. if there is no obstruction to the passage of Vaayu then Sneha can be administered, if the passage is obstructed then Mridu S`hodhana along with Sneha is advised. (C.Chi.9/25) Pittaja Unmaada: The patient is subjected to Virechana after conditioned Snehana followed by proper Samsarjana Krama. Thereafter depending on the predominance of the Dosha Nirooha Basti, Sneha Basti and S`hirovirechana are administered frequently. Aahaara - S`heeta, Madhura and Laghu Aahaara should be consumed. Kaphaja Unmaada: Snehana Svedana Vamana Samsarjana Krama Frequent use of Nirooha Basti, Sneha Basti and S`hiro Virechana(as per dominance of Dosha) By adopting these measures when the body is cleansed, the mind becomes clear (devoid of Mada) or a sense of well being is seen.

Vicharchikaa, or eczema, is a common skin condition that can manifest as a separate disease or as a symptom of another underlying condition, such as Tamaka Shvaasa.\n\nUnderstanding the root causes of Vicharchikaa is crucial for effective treatment. Ayurveda believes that skin conditions arise due to imbalances in the three doshas (bioenergies): Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. External factors like environmental pollutants and certain plants can also trigger Vicharchikaa.\n\nEarly symptoms of Vicharchikaa include itching, especially in the groin area. As the condition progresses, specific symptoms emerge depending on the predominant dosha involved. For instance, Vata dosha causes dryness and discoloration, Pitta dosha leads to burning and pus formation, and Kapha dosha manifests as excessive itching and thick exudate.\n\nAyurvedic treatment for Vicharchikaa involves both internal and external therapies. Panchakarma, a detoxification process, is often employed to eliminate excess doshas. S'hamana Chikitsaa, a pacifying treatment, follows to restore balance.\n\nExternal applications like herbal pastes and ointments provide instant relief from itching and discoloration. Rubbing treatments with herbs like neem leaves promote skin healing. Ayurvedic medicines, tailored to the specific dosha imbalance, are also prescribed. These may include herbs like Manjisht'haa, Khadira, and Yastimadhu.\n\nAyurveda offers a comprehensive approach to managing Vicharchikaa, addressing both the underlying imbalances and providing symptomatic relief.", "is_summary_swapped": false}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["tag", "file_path", "file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5b9e87c6-79e7-40c4-ada5-f75bd0d105eb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/dai/rag/data/clean_html/Articles/Chikitsaa/Vicharchikaa.htm", "file_name": "Vicharchikaa.htm", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 9303, "creation_date": "2024-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-14", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-15"}, "hash": "2afc3bfa461f2abc52dba2f5f4f29bb2ac3508a84a54924c8b8276b3cda46b9e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Vicharchikaa A Critical Disease Now a day, importance of Ayurveda is on the rise everywhere in the world. In modern era Ayurvedic scientific views and medicines are as useful as, they were in ancient days. In day to day practice we come across many patients whose condition is almost irreversible. Many of these chronic and irreversible conditions are skin conditions, some typical and some atypical. Onset of skin condition is generally gradual and when the disease gets noticed, it is already in chronic stage, requiring many weeks or month for treatment, in these diseases Vicharchikaa i.e. Eczema is a very common disease of the skin. It may be as a separate disease, or as a side effect of one of the symptoms of the any other main disease e.g. Vicharchikaa is very common in Tamaka S`hvaasa. Therefore, unless Tamaka S`hvaasa is treated properly, Vicharchikaa will not come under control. If the same Vicharchikaa is due to some other reason e.g. contact with Pyrethrum Grass (Congress Grass), then we have to concentrate in localized treatment. Skin conditions as a group are called as Kusht`ha, in Ayurveda science, Aachaarya Sus`hruta says: In practice also, we find that this observation of Aachaarya Sus`hruta is very practical and apt as,it requires many years of treatment, even if there are no symptoms. We are not really sure that patient is definitely cured, because any change in climate or diet, in emotions of the patient may suddenly give rise to relapse. Etiology It is said that skin is the first line of defense against any external contact. The deteriorating environment and growing amount of pollutants in air, water etc. means this front line of defense producing many skin manifestations due to the infra red reaction. We can say in short, everything under the sun, including the sun, is causative factor of the skin diseases. Ayurveda believes that any effect or Kaarya has the same properties as its causative factor or Kaaran`a Hetu. If we know the properties of Kaaran`a, then we can employ the opposite properties to regain equilibrium of Dosha and thus restore health and cure disease. Though a separate list of etiological factors of Vicharchikaa is not given specifically in any of the classical text, Charakaachaarya has listed following factors as causes of Kusht`ha and at the end of this list he says: This means this list is applicable to all types of Kusht`ha and Vicharchikaa is one of the types of Kshudra Kusht`ha. This list is applicable to Vicharchikaa also. Some typical etiological factors: Bhela Samhitaa has given some more causes Prodromal Symptoms: If the patient does come early with symptoms like itching, particularly itching in inguinal region or all over the body, then it is better to rule out Prameha, because if it is Prameha, then usually treating Prameha appropriately and controlling blood sugar, will usually relieve the symptoms. Symptoms: These are the definite symptoms of Vicharchikaa. Other symptoms change according to predominance of Dosha. They are as follows: Vaata Dosha: Excessive dryness, roughness, dark discoloration or blackening spreads rapidly, irregular. Pitta Dosha: Burning, suppuration, exudation, pus formation, foul smelling, skin lesion is thin and hot, reddish or blackish color, exudate is thin, liquid and reddish. Kapha Dosha: Excessive itching, sticky, whitish thick exudate, chronic, colours white, dark, well defined margins, invariably but slowly increasing in size. Mix predominance of two or three Dosha may be seen many times. Pathogenesis: Internal causative factors Variations in Kusht`ha are innumerable, depending upon the Vikalpanaa of causative factors, Dosha, Dushya, location, colour, pain and potent specific effect. Differential Diagnosis: In every case of Vicharchikaa we have to decide, whether it is an independent disease or is it dependent on some other disease. Particularly we should inquire about Tamaka S`hvaasa. Diagnosing Tamaka S`hvaasa is not sufficient to successfully treat Vicharchikaa as a symptom. We have to go into Vikalpa Sampraapti. If the origin of Tamaka S`hvaasa is in Aamaashaya, the treatment is different, as lungs originate from the Prasad part of Rakta Dhaatu This happens due to internal correlation between Rakta Dhaatu & skin. There are seven main factors, which takes part in the formation of the skin diseases. In that, the Rakta Dhaatu is one of the factors. The formation of lung is -  When Rakta Dhaatu gets affected in Tamaka S`hvaasa, the pathology may extend to skin and skin disease starts. So here we have to think of Raktamokshan`a and various Raktaprasaadana drugs like Manjisht`haa, Saarivaa etc. But in case of Aamaas`hayodbhava Tamaka S`hvaasa, we have to think of Vamana & Kaphagna medicines like Pippali, Maricha etc. We may even prefer Vardhamaana Pippali Rasaayana to get rid of both Tamaka S`hvaasa and Vicharchikaa. In short we have to give tailor-made treatment for every patient and here the skill of physician is most important. Treatment: Almost all procedures of Panchkarma therapy and their subtypes are useful in Vicharchikaa e.g. Vamana, Virechana etc. The proper use of all this Panchakarma therapy is to eliminate the offending Dosha. After this is achieved, then we can turn to S`hamana Chikitsaa to pacify the remaining Dosha. The treatment is in two parts 1. S`hodhana 2. S`hamana Panchakarma Gun`aateetam Kust`ham| External application: Local or external treatment begins with Lepa, as retention of Lepa is instantly beneficial. Baahya Lepanam Prayogah Sadyah Siddhidaayakah| Other local treatment includes use of the Kshaara Prayoga and Visha Pralepa (poison materials) Most important is rubbing treatment of Patrapot`t`alee. The herbs used for this karma are Nimbpatra, Danti, Lataakaranja etc. Nimbapatrapot`t`alee The most important rubbing treatment, as it is instantly useful, because of digestion of local Saama Dosha, thereby reducing itching, discoloration, thickening etc and improving skin colour. Nowadays various ointments are also available. Various medicines can be used as per determination of Dosha predominance and his treatment accordingly: e.g. Aarogyavardhini Vat`ee, Rasamaan`ikya, Vanga Bhasma, Trivanga Bhasma, Daaruharidraa Churn`a, Manjsht`haa Churn`a, Khadira Churn`a, Jat`amaamsee, Yast`imadhu, Vid`anga, Nis`hottara, Mahamanjisht`haadi Kad`haa, Khadiraarisht`a, Mahaatiktaka Ghrita etc. Medicine changes according to disease and condition. There are so many other medicines, which are also available, which can be used in different conditions of the skin problems. I am sure with these tips, I have given you, will be able to enlarge your repertory and successfully treat patients of skin diseases with Ayurvedic way of thinking.

Here Kapha Sthaanagata means Oordhva Kaayagata Visarpa. Along with Langhana Tikta Rasa Sevana. Vishesha Chikitsaa advised is Rakta Mokshan`a and Virechana. Here Pitta Sthaanagata means Madhya Kaayagata Visarpa. . (C.Chi.21/45). Rooks`han`a Chikitsaa is advised. Also Snehana is contraindicated in the initial stage of treatment if there is association (Anubandha) of Rakta or Pitta i.e, Rookshan`a Chikitsaa only has to be employed. . (C.Chi.21/46). Medicated ghee that has the purgative action should be used. (The ghee to be used in Bahudoshavasthaa should essentially have Virechana action). If such ghee is not used then the Dosha_s become immovable or rigid (Sthabdha) and settle down in Tvacha, Rakta and Maamsa and bring about suppuration (Paaka) of the same. Hence Virechana should be advised in Visarpa. . (C.Chi.21/48). Raktamokshan`a is always advised during the initial stage, because blood (Rakta) being the main seat (Aas`hraya) of Visarpa, hence when vitiated blood is let out it pacifies the disease. (C.Chi21/48-49) Mahaatiktaka Ghrita of Kusht`ha and Traayamaan`a Ghrita of Gulma Adhikaara should be used. S`haakahagata Visarpa Chikitsaa:  S`hamana Chikitsa: After Proper S`hodhana (by Virechana,Raktamohshan`a etc.), when the Dosha_s settle in the Tvak and Maamsa OR in condition where the strength of the Dosha_s is mild, in such conditions Baahya (Lepa, Pradeha) Chikitsaa is advised. (C.Chi.21/68-71)  Method of applying Pradeha: The Lepa should not be stale (Paryushita). The Lepa once removed should not be reapplied. (C.Chi.21/101-102) (A.H.Chi.18/18-19) The Lepa should not be wrapped in a cloth and applied. If applied then the heat of the body does not get transferred and hence it causes Svedana, causing Pidaka(boils) and Kan`d`oo(Itching) at that site. As a result Kleda and S`hoola also develops in Visarpa. (C.Chi.21/103) But Vagbhata is of the opinion that the Lepa should be smeared on a cloth and then applied. (A.H.Chi.18/18-19) Lepa should not be applied one above the other, it leads to the same sequences as above i.e. it causes Pidaka,Kan`d`oo, Kleda, S`hoola. (C.Chi.21/104). Similarly the Lepa should neither be Ati Snigdha (Over Unctuous) nor Ati Drava (very liquid) in nature as it does not remain on the site and hence cannot pacify the Dosha_s. (C.Chi.21/105). {If the Lepa is too much diluted or watery in nature then it dries off quickly, the Rasa and Veerya of the drug does not reach the Vyadhi Moola as it dries of quickly. (C.Chi.21/106).Similarly if the Lepa is devoid of Sneha (unctuous), it also dries off without giving the desired effect. (C.Chi.21/107)} Properties of Pralepa: Kalka of the Dravya used should be applied. Thickness of Pralepa should be 1/3rd of the Angus`hta and it should be neither too Snigdha (unctuous) nor Rooksha (Dry) or Pinda (bolus) nor Drava (liquid). (C.Chi.21/68-70) Granthi Visarpa Chikitsaa: Importance of Raktamoks`han`a in Visarpa: Just as Basti Chikitsaa is considered as Ardha Chikitsaa in Vaata Vyaadhi, Similarly in this context Raktamoks`han`a is considered as Ardha Chikitsa.

These aggravated Dosha mingle with undigested food, which remains in stomach in un- assimilated form. This further leads to manifest typical pricking pain (like pricking by needle). So this complete clinical manifestation is called as Visoochikaa.(A.H.Su.8/7-8) Severe reduction of digestive power is the principle component in Visoochikaa. So while treating Visoochikaa one should always focus on enhancement of Agni (Digestive power). Avasthika Chikitsaa Aggravated state of Visoochikaa  It is advisable to perform Agnikarma at Paarshn`ee (Calcaneus region). Patient should remain fasting for a day, followed by regular treatment protocol like in Virechana (Samsarjana Krama) In Saadhya Visoochikaa, Paarshn`ee Daaha (i.e. Agnikarma at Calcaneus region) helps to arrest extensive diarrhea.

Owing to this major lacuna there exists a lack of new techniques, which are dedicated to the assessment and evaluation of new substances. As indigenous medical practitioners it is our prime duty to understand the substances that have become an inseparable part of our day to day life. Unless this is achieved it would be well nigh impossible to correctly diagnose and treat effectively by drugs and diet the condition present. It is our endeavor to present before you the assessment we have done of the substance called Custard, which has now become a part of the Indian diet in the urban areas. The parameters have been supplied by the ancient seers in their texts namely the Pancahbhoota theory, Rasa- Gun`a- Veerya theory and Dosha-Dhaatu-Mala theory. We sincerely believe that this attempt is in the correct direction and by no means our last work. Our main aim is to initiate a meaningful dialogue and exchange of thoughts on this intriguing topic. We are well aware of our limitations and shall be only too glad to those who would sincerely point out these because by only by logic based exchange can one establish the ultimate truth. The substance under study - Custard is a gift from the west. It belongs to the Anna Kritaanna Varga. It is generally consumed after meals as a sweet dish or dessert, preceded by refrigeration. Common ingredients of Custard Corn starch, milk, sugar- all in equal parts  Salt to taste, Water - as required  Beaten eggs - if desired in pudding or soft baked Custard. Procedure Stage 1: Mix the dry ingredients first-corn starch, sugar and salt thoroughly. Stage 2: Add some cold milk enough to make a smooth paste. Stage 3: Add hot milk, enough to make a homogenous emulsion.   Stage 4: Cook on low flame till ready, stir constantly to avoid lumping. Standards for a good Custard Texture - Smooth, devoid of lumps Consistency - Firm and tender, homogenous, should not be leathery or watery. Flavor - pleasing, delicate, should not be strong. It should be like thick cream yielding easily without sound to any sharp instrument or pressure Evaluation of Custard on Ayurvedic Parameters S`habda - does not make any specific sound. It is cut without making sound. Spars`ha-Tactile  Snigdha - Unctuous  S`heeta - Cold  Pichchhila - Slimy, tends to move, trembles and is paste like  Guru - Heavy or bulky  Mridu - Mild, soft, yielding to touch Roopa - Visual  Peeta - yellowish in colour  Aardra - looks moist  Saandra - looks thick, well formed and not liquid, glistens if well set Rasa - Taste  Madhura - Sweet  Asyopalepa - creates stickiness in the mouth  Hlaadana - crates a sense of well being elation on tasting  Shadindriyaprasaadana - causes a sated state of all the sense organs and the mind  Smells sweet on tasting Gandha - Smell  Saumya - mild, likeable, Agreeable smell, inoffensive  Sugandha - fragrance. After noting these properties it now becomes possible for us to pose a working hypothesis regarding the Rasa-Gun`a-Veerya-Vipaaka and their Dosha-Dhaatu-Mala relationships as well as their effects. This would be apparent by the following table. Gun`a - P - Present Hence the Bhautika Constitution is water predominant, with Earth contributing secondly and with Ether in an infinitesimal manner. Fire and air are conspicuous by their absence. Rasa - Madhura  Veerya  S`heeta  Vipaaka - (post digestive taste)  Madhura Effect on the Dosha: Because of this constitution it Annihilates / alleviates the Vaata Dosha and Pitta Dosha due to its sweetness in taste and effect as well as cold phase activity.Generates / intensifies Kapha - due to its common and comparable taste, effect, phase and properties. It exhibits the following actions on the various bodily constituents. Effect on Dhaatu: Rasa - Rasavardhana owing to its common and comparable constitution.  Rakta - Raktaprasaadana due to its sweet and cold effect.  Maamsa - due its sweet, dense and heavy attributes.  Meda - Medavivardhana due to comparable constitution.  S`hukra S`hukravardhana due to Madhura taste, S`heeta, Snigdha, Saandra, Manda and Gun`a and Veerya, Sugandha attributes and cold phase activity. Effect on the byproducts of Dhaatu (Updhaatu): Raja and Stanya - Vriddhikara due to its Rasa generative action on waste products.  Sris`ht`ra Mutrakara due to its sweet effect and Gurutva.  Sris`ht`ra Malakara due to its sweet effect and Gurutva.  It facilitates an easy flow out for the fecal matter and the urine from the body. Some other important actions are as follows : Abhishyandi - A substance which is capable of occluding the Rasaayani and causing accumulation of Rasa and heaviness owing to its Pichchhila (slimy character), Gurutva (heavy on digestion and conversion) and its affinity towards Rasa Dhaatu.   Rakta Prasaadana - Capable of purifying the Rakta Dhaatu, due to its sweet taste, post digestive taste and cold phase activity.   Upalepakara - A substance which is capable of sticking to the surface in contact and causing bulkiness, owing to its Pichchhilataa, Saandrataa and Mridutaa. Custard and its therapeutic uses: In case of Amlapitta characterized by Daaha there is a subjective burning sensation. It is advisable to lick it (Leha).   In case of Mukhapaaka (stomatitis) - It is advised to suck and lick it with the finger. It brings about the drop in intensity due to Mridu, S`heeta and Pichchhila attributes.   In Case of Vaatika, Paittika Trishn`aa (Thirst) it proves beneficial- but owing to its Guru, Manda, Mridu and Pichchhila attributes it is totally contraindicated in the Aamaja type or Trishn`aa. In Case of S`hosha (wasting disorders) it can be beneficially administered but caution has to be observed and it should never be given after sunset, because of its Abhishyandi, Guru attributes.   In case of Malavibandha (Constipation and irregular bowel habits), it is administered in the Apaana Kaala or Samaana Kaala depending upon the dominance of Vaata type involved.   It is also used in Kris`ha (emaciated) persons successfully to promote weight gain after considering the status of his / her Agni.   It proves beneficial to the persons of Vaata Prakriti and Pitta Prakriti as Svasthavrittikara Dravya.   Its use in Jaangala Des`ha (geo-physical distribution) is advisable.   Its use is beneficial in the Hemanta (Autumn) S`his`hira (Winter) and Greeshma (Summer).   Its use is contraindicated in diseases conditions like Pratis`hyaaya S`hvaasa  Kapha predominant Kaasa-Kapha predominant Agnimaandya Pravaahikaa Atisaara Grahan`ee Hridroga- Kaphaja S`hotha Medogoga Dhamani Pratichaya Mootraaghaata Based on the foregoing discussion it is possible to apply the same line of thinking and discover new indications and contraindications. It is our sincere wish to impress upon the fresh graduates that the science of life holds true even now, in this rapidly changing word of today. Conclusion The principles of Ayurveda can be used to elucidate the medicinal properties of new food stuffs or medicinal substances. This point is proved in this article with the example of Custard.

It involves the discussion of every aspect related to human life. As mentioned in Charaka Samhitaa, Hitaahitam Sukham Duhkham Aayustasya Hitaahitam..C.Su. 1/41 [That is named the Veda of life, wherein is told the good and the bad life, the happy and unhappy life, wholesome and unwholesome in relation to life, and also the measure of life.] Ayurveda, with a broader canvas, has no time and space limits. It is a continuous flow of knowledge with time tested core principles, taking cognizance of contemporary changes around and along these core principles. Anukta Dravya Vichaara is one of the important subjects in Ayurveda. It is an example of cognizance of contemporary changes that take place in the society. The Anukta Dravya Vichaara is an important subject for an Ayurvedic practitioner. In clinical practice many food items have to be taken notice of as they may emerge as certain type of causative factors as described in texts. Similarly the persons traveling from place to place or from one country to another are to be advised about the locally available foods and accordingly about the system of consumption of food. Practically every Ayurvedic practitioner faces these problems in the practice. 1.2.1 What is Anukta? The word Anukta is derived from the root vac with negation attached to the basic root. Thus Anukta literally means unsaid, unuttered and unheard of. With specific reference to Ayurveda, the entity, which is not directly or specifically mentioned in the Ayurvedic texts, is Anukta. What is Dravya? Concept of Dravya is well defined in the Ayurvedic texts. Various types and subtypes are elaborated at length. For example, the basic division is Kaaran`a Dravya and Kaarya Dravya. The Kaarya Dravya is further classified according to the Mahaabhuta dominance, tastes, properties, actions on the body etc. Respected commentator Chakrapaan`i divides Dravya as Aushadhi and Aahaara Dravya in certain reference. (C.Su. 2/11 Chakrapaan`i.) In this work, the word Dravya from the term Anukta Dravya Vichaara denotes the Aahaara Dravya (food articles) only. 1.2.3 What is Anukta Aahaara Dravya Vichaara ? Anukta Dravya Vichaara for this work is operationally defined as ' a detailed Ayurvedic investigation of properties of an Anukta Aahara Dravya and its probable role in human diet.'  Types of Anukta: There are six Padaart`ha according to Ayurveda. Hence there are six types of Ankuta. Dravya Anukta - Yatkinchit Kaphavaataghnamusnam Vaataanulomanam| Bheshajam Paanamannam Vaa Tadhitam S`hvaasahikkine||Ca.Ci.17/147. (Whatever medicine or food is Kaphavaataghna, Ushn`a and Vaataanulomana, is wholesome for a patient of S`hvaasa and Hikkaa.) This Sootra is from the S`hvaasa Chikitsaa. It does not indicate any specific food and/or medicine, but tells the general properties to be used in the treatment. Here the selection of specific food, medicine is to be done by Vaidya. This is example of Dravyaanukta. Gun`a Anukta - Dravyamoordhvagamam Tatra Praayognipavanotkat`am|| AS.Su.9/11(The Dravya with a upward leading tendency generally bears Utkat`a (dominant) Agni and Pavana properties) This sutra does not indicate the properties but tells some specific trends. On the basis of this information one has to define the properties of such a Dravya. Karma Anukta - Svaadu S`heetam Mridu Snigdham Bahalam S`hlakshn`a Pichchhilam| Guru Mandam Prasannamcha Gavyam Das`hagun`am Payah| Bhav. 27/217 (The cow milk has ten properties that is Svaadu, Sita, Mridu, Snigdha, Bahala, S`hlaksn`a, Pichchhila, Guru, Manda, Prasanna.) This Sootra does not tell about the possible action of the cow milk on the body but the general properties are elaborated. A Vaidya has to specify the actions accordingly. Saamaanya Anukta During the general reading it was observed that Kut`aja and Kut`akee appear as group in many medicines. Apparently these medicines bear nearly opposite properties. It was found that there are about 400 medicines in which these two appear as a group. After an analysis it was clear that when there is involvement of Rasadhaatu and Aamasaya, these medicines can be used along with other medicines. This commonness (Saamaanya) is not mentioned in the texts but was known after the analysis of information. This is an example of Saamanya Anukta. Vis`hesha Ankuta  Duhspars`hakena Bilvena Yavaanya Naagaren`a Vaa | Ekaikenaapi Samyuktaa Paat`haa Hanti Ars`hasaam Rujam || C. Chi 14/100(The Paatha, even used either with Dhamaasa or Bilva or Yavaanee or Naagara; reduces the pain of Ars`ha.) This sutra is read in the Ars`ha Chikitsaa. It does not directly mention the exact stage at which these medicines are to be used in the treatment of Ars`ha. It gives general information and the specifics are to be derived. This is an example of Vis`hesha Anukta.  Samavaaya Anukta  Chetanaadhaaturapyekah Smritah Purushasadnyakah| C. Sha 1/16 [The Chetanaa Dhaatu alone is also known as (Chikitsaa) Purusha] In this Sootra, the Deha Mana Indriya are not mentioned neither their perpetual existence. This is an example of Samavaaya Anukta. The Ayurvedic texts like the other ancient Indian texts are in the Samhitaa  form. This specific form expects and enjoys ' to be in brief . As they generally say, Ekamaatra Laaghavena Putrotsavam Manyante Vaiyaakaran`ah| (if the grammarians are able to save a Maatraa; they celebrate as if joy of birth of a son). This expected briefness does not allow taking notice of every available entity. Neither it is possible to take notice of every minute detail in modern descriptive forms. The scientists mention the representative sample and expect ' to derive more on the same lines . The respected text says Dis`hanayaa Chaapi Svayamooheta Buddhimaana |A. S. Su 7/261 (a scholar should discuss more on the basis of this direction.) The representative sample thus discussed is what appears most frequently, most of the time and seen most commonly. It is labeled by the texts as Praayika, Praayopayogika or Aaviskritatama. The entities, which are not that much important in contemporary reference are not discussed and remain Anukta during that specific frame of reference. Here are some quotes from the texts to explain the point. Na S`hakyam Vistaren`aapi Vaktum Sarvam Tu Sarvathaa| Hitaahitatve Api Ekaantaniyamo Asmad Anischitah|| A.S.Su. 7/209 (It is not possible to speak about everything every time. Though wholesome (are these medicines etc) there is no specific rule. ) Saamaanyadaras`hanenaasaam Vyasvasthaa Sampradarsitaah| Su. U. 65/41 (This system is described in general.) S`hukas`himbeejapakvaannamaamsas`haakaphalausadhaih|Vargitairannales`hoayamukto Nityopayogikah|| A. H. Su 6/172 (From the S`huka, S`himbi, Pakva Anna, Maamsa, S`haaka, Phala and Aushadhi; what is used regularly is told.) Yasya Tu Kaadaachitka Upayogah Satu Noktah Granthavistarabhayaat | Ayurvedarasaayana T`eekaa [what is used sometimes, is not told because of the constraint of enlargement in volume of book.]  Any entity which makes its impact on comparatively large population becomes important in social life and also when the impact remains for a considerable period of time within the society. Both types of entities have to be taken into account by all contemporary social sciences. For example- Y 2 K was an important factor for the world during the years 1998- 1999. It affected various sectors of population for various reasons. During those days the main focus of grape vine was on Y2K alone and somehow all other issues were comparatively sidelined. Such an entity is called Praayika or Avis`hkritatama other less important factors remain Anukta. Another reason for Anukta is unavailability during particular frame of period and/or space. For example, the backache due to two wheeler driving has been a common problem in Pune since last few years. It was not that much important before, neither it is a serious problem for the people in Mumbai, but nowadays it has a Praayika status for people in Pune. Practically every Vaidya has a number of patients of such kind and it has been a subject handled for M.D. dissertation also. In short, the main reasons for being Anukta can be summarized as Apraayikatva - less importance and Anupalabdhi - non availability. 1.2.6 Necessity of Anukta Vichaara. Anukta Vichaara always remains an important subject because of the continuous changes that are taking place in the society. As it is generally said - The only constant is change. These changes bring along many positives and negatives, pluses and minuses, divisions and subtractions in the society; which ultimately affect the health of an individual and/or of society in general. The Praayika factor also changes according to the societal changes. The general population describes the changes as something NEW. This nomenclature is alright when common people use the word. But an Ayurvedic person has to call it ANUKTA because Ayurveda can analyze those changes on the basis of its core principles. If an Ayurvedic person uses the term NEW then it sequels that it is outside the context of the Ayurvedic core principles. Charaka says, `Yadihaasti Tadanyatra Yannehaasti Na Tat Kvachit | Ca.Si 12/54 (whatever is here may be found elsewhere, whatever is not here is nowhere) this is not boasting of Charaka but it is a guideline to analyze that changes on the basis of core principles. To analyze the change and to define and derive the wholesomeness-unwholesomeness of such changes for common people, the Anukta Vichaara is must. An Ayurvedic practitioner (or any medical practitioner for that matter) is sought after by healthy and /or sick, ailing persons for health advise. Both preventive and curative purposes are to be thought over. In both the aspects the detailed inquiry of food habits is obligatory. The food generally eaten by people contains hardly any Ukta items or raw materials or the preparation processes. Thus the Anukta Vichaara of food becomes essential. Nowadays the changes in food preparation and eating habits are remarkable. The South Indian dishes are available all over the world. The Chinese dishes are enjoyed at nearby corners of average Indian cities. The most common food of Maaharashtra Pit`hala-Bhaakaree has now received five star status. Television and other media coverage are providing new recipes from and to the people all over the world. With specific reference to food items and food habits, the Anukta Vichaara becomes necessary because of.. Additions: - Nowadays many food materials are becoming available. New processes of food preparation are also accepted in the average life. The availability of Palm oil, Soya oil and commodities like pressure- cooker, non-stick pans are a few examples of additions. Need of alternatives: - Some classic food materials are nowadays not easily available everywhere and always due to many reasons. For example, Tila Taila though highly recommended in the texts is not easily available or if available, is often compared to the cost of other available oils. Such facts do indicate the Anukta Dravya Vichaara in search of an alternative to the Tila Taila. Changes in the properties. - The continuously growing population demanded and was provided with purposely developed varieties of food grains. The properties of these developed varieties are not exactly the same as mentioned in Ayurvedic texts. The properties of such grain varieties do need fresh investigation. Similarly the technical processes of preparation of jaggery, sugar etc is different as compared to conventional processes and these processes need to be studied freshly. 1.2.7 Is the Anukta Vichaara intended in Ayurveda? Ayurveda texts do positively recommend the investigation of Anukta Dravya. The following quotations may help to clear the view of Ayurveda regarding Anukta Vichaara. Suraamanthaasavaarisht`aamllehaams`hchoorn`aanyayskriteeh| Sahasras`hoapi Kurvrrta Bijenaanena Buddhimaana || Su.Chi. 10/16. (A scholar should make thousands of Suraa, Mantha, Aasava, Arisht`a, Leha, Churn`a, Ayaskritih with this principle.) Rogaa Ye Apyatra Noddisht`aa Bahutvaat Naamarupatah| Teshaamapi Etat Eva Syaat Doshaadeen Veekshya Bheshajam||C.Chi. 30/291 (The diseases which are not described because of their nomenclature is vast, they should be treated similarly considering the Dosha etc.) Yachchaanyadapi Kinchit Syaad Anuktamiha Poojitam |Vrittam Tadapi Chaatreyah Sadaivaabhyanumanyate || C.Su 8/34.(Whatever other observances there may be which is not spoken here, but is worshipped (in society), Atreya always recommends it (to be accepted).) Here the word ' observance' is to be considered in its broader sense and hence it indicates the healthy customs of food preparation and food consumption. Sometimes the texts themselves explain about the Anukta in the text. for example Kaale Anukte Prabhaatam Syat Ange Anukte Jat`aa Bhaveta| Bhaage Anukte Tu Samyam Sayat, Paatre Anukte Mrin`mayam|| Drave Anukte Jalam Graahyam, Taile Anukte Tilodbhavam | Sh.S.P. 1/47-48 [If Kaala is Anukta, the morning is to be known, the root is to be known if any specific part of herb is not told, every item should be taken in equal parts if the exact proportion is not told, the earthen pot should be used unless mentioned specific, water should be taken if any liquid is not mentioned and oil of Tila should be taken if any specific is not told.] Apart from these direct references, some indirect references indicate the Anukta Vichaara. E.g. Dhaatun Malaan Vaa Dehasya Vis`hoshya Ullekhayecha Tam| Lekhanam Tadyathaa Kshaudram Niram Ushn`am Vachaa Yavaah| Sh.S.P. 4/10(The (medicine) which dries and scratches the Dhaatu and Mala of the body, is (called) Lekhana that is like honey, hot water, Vachaa and the Yava) the commentator explains the Anukta Vichaara in his commentary that the word Yavah being plural indicates the use of other medicines of similar properties.  The discussion of diseases like Phiranga-Upadams`ha and the discussion of medicines like Ahiphena and Chopachini in the chronologically later texts like Bhaavaprakaas`ha are direct examples of the then Anukta Vichaara appearing in contemporary Ayurvedic texts.  1.2.8 Limits of Anukta Vichaara Though the Anukta Vichaara is intended in Ayurveda, it has certain limits. For example, in the chapter of Viruddha Aahaara, it has been said..... Viruddharasaveeryaan`eeti Atra Vairodhikatvenoktaanyeva Viruddharasaani Viruddhaveeryaan`i Cha Yathaayogyatayaa Uhaneeyaani | Na Tvatraanukte Api Viruddharasatvaadikalpanaa; Tathaahi Sati Payo Api S`hitamushn`ena Viruddham Syaat, Paanakaadi Madhuraamlarasam Rasa Viruddhatvaat Viruddham Syat Iti Cakrah | S. Su. 20/ 19 (Footnote) (According to Chakrapaan`i, those Viruddha Rasa-Veerya should be appropriately discussed which are told to be Viruddha, here one should not think of any Viruddha which is not told. If it is done, Sita milk in the hot state would become Viruddha, and as the Paanaka etc include sweet and sour tastes, may become Rasa Viruddha.)

There are various rules for the drug action explained in Aayurveda. These are mainly related to the factors in the drug and in the body by which drugs act on live body. To know the consequences of the drug administered, one has to know all the possibilities of the actions going to happen in the body. For this one must know all the rules of the same. Though this is a complex phenomenon it can be stated as below. Factors Included: Therapeutic action of a drug is a complex phenomenon which includes two main factors. Properties of the drug 1 a. Rasa (Taste) b. Vipaaka (Taste after digestion) c. Veerya (Potency / Distinct attributes) d. Gun`a (Attributes) e. Prabhaava (Specific property of drug) d. Samyoga (Synergetic / Antagonist action) 2. Other factors 2 -  a. Dosha (Vaata, Pitta, Kapha) b. Dhaatu (Basic body tissues) c. Des`ha (Surroundings / site) d. Bala (Strength) e. Kaala (Seasons / Diurnal variations / Duration of disease) f. Agni (Digestive capacity) g. Prakriti (Constitution) h. Vaya (Age / Chronological age) i. Sattva (Mental status) j. Saatmya (Hypersensitivity / Acceptance / Homologation) k. Aahaara (Diet) l. Avasthaa (Diseases / Various types, conditions, stage of disease etc.) Rules for Drug Action: Drug action depends on these basic minimum factors. Drug selection is based on consideration of all these factors simultaneously. Drug can act by its Rasa, Vipaaka, Veerya or Prabhaava. 3 (Please see the table.) Gun`a act as supporting factors to all of these. Prabhaava is very specific and potent action of a drug, which is irrespective of Rasa, Gun`a etc. 4 General rule for the drug action is Vipaaka works more effectively than Rasa, Veerya works more effectively than Vipaaka and Rasa, and Prabhaava works overpowers the effects of all these, when all are equipotent. A.H.Su.9 Specific Rule or the Exceptional Rule is that sometimes drug acts by Rasa, sometimes by Vipaaka, sometimes by Gun`a or Veerya or by Prabhaava. A.H.Su.9 Agni is the key factor in the body which provides the base to change the drug into compatible form to the body by breaking it down to appropriate level. Exceptions are Visha Dravya (poisonous substances like nux-vomica), Vyavaayee 5 and Vikaasee 5 Dravya like Bhangaa (Cannabis sativa) these dont need the initial phase of transformation by Agni. One drug can have more than one action and those can be observed at different target organs. Moreover properties of the drug can be changed as per processing, dose, vehicle etc. But the action can be explained in terms of Duration of the action and the organ affected. The general statements are possible based on physiology. Route Internal. 1. Time interval for the peak activity. Generally it is between 6 to 24 hrs after drug administration. 6 Ushn`a, Teekshn`a drugs act fast. (< 6 hrs) Poisonous drugs act faster than any other drugs. (immediate or < 6 hrs) Herbo-mineral drugs act faster than herbal drugs. (immediate or < 6 hrs) In case of presence of Aama, poor quality of Agni it cant act or acts partially and slowly. (> 6 hrs) 2. Time required for drug action in case of different tissues. 7 Rasa -  01 Day Rakta - 05 Days Maamsa - 10 Days Meda - 15 Days Asthi - 20 Days Majja - 25 Days S`hukra - 30 Days Summary: Any drug witch acts upon the body, acts by it attributes with the help of other factors, some inside the body and some extrinsic factors like Kaala (Time / Seasons / Diurnal variations), Des`ha (Surroundings, geo specific locations) etc. Drug obeys any or all of the rules during the action on the body. The duration of the action depends upon the target organ or tissue, condition of Agni and attributes or type of drug or the dosage form. Reference: 1. Ashtanga Hrudaya by Vagbhatacharya, Pub.

A. Dole M.D. (Ayurved) Rasashastra Rasas`haastra is the science and art of preparation of drugs from various minerals and metals. Many plant, animal, and oceanic products are also used for preparation of such drugs at various stages. Mercury, in most of such drugs is the main ingredient, but not necessarily a compulsory constituent. Even though this science has now completely merged with that of Ayurveda, originally it was conceived, formed and developed as a separate science. Medicinal use of various mineral substances such as Chalkapyrite, (Maakshika) Orpiment Arsenic Trisulphide, (Harataala) Realgar (Arsenic disulphide, (Manahs`hilaa), metals such as gold, copper, silver, Iron etc were known and described in compendium of Charaka whose period is supposed to be 2000 years BC. Mercury, the principal metal described in Rasas`haastra is also mentioned there. However, their dosage-forms and indications appear to be very limited. Hence it can be stated that roots of Rasas`haastra can be traced back to the period of Charaka or even further back. Before postulating when the Rasas`haastra originated, it will be interesting to note why it originated and how. To understand this, one needs to have knowledge of few concepts: Now to gain the objectives mentioned in the form of three instincts above, Mercury was the Matter of Choice, naturally. It was experimented upon over a period of hundreds of years. During this period results (both  agreeable and harmful) were noted and corrected with new experiments. The nature of these experiments consisted of mixing, triturating, heating, boiling, distillation. Mercury with various metals minerals, plants and oceanic products. Regarding the objectives of origin of this science, there are two schools of thought. The western schools of thought consider that converting non-precious metals into precious metals, and thereby gaining enormous wealth, was the main objective. The other school of thought, which prevails in eastern countries, considers mercury, a product from Lord Shiva as a means to achieve longevity, to be utilized for service of God by which one can attain the ultimate bliss, Moksha. The part of converting non-precious metal in to precious metals (Lohavedha) was a sort of test to see whether the mercury had gained adequate power to produce the required longevity and disease free condition of the human body. Where exactly did this science originate? Again there are two different opinions. As per one, it began in the mid-eastern part of the world. The limited knowledge gained was exported to the Indian subcontinent through various series of military operations and campaigns. Such campaign is usually followed by exodus of knowledge and cultural exchanges. The evidences, which are available, substantiate this fact. In fact it is believed that the modern science of chemistry evolved from there. The name of the place was Chemia & hence the word chemist. The second opinion is exactly the opposite. It postulates that the science of Rasas`haastra originated and developed in India and then was exported to other countries. A single point of debate, which goes against this theory, is to be noted here. Geographically & geologically, there are not any mines of Mercury ores in either the Himalayan mountain range or in the Indian subcontinent. Then how come a science, which has mercury as a single most important drug, could be developed in India. But other evidences, which are freely available, clearly indicate that this science was conceived and developed in the subcontinent and then spread elsewhere. As per such evidences mercury and mercurial products were brought in India by road through various passes in the Himalayan mountain range. This theory can be conceived from circumstantial evidences available in various books and compendias. The approximate period of these books can be inferred. In the Charaka Samhitaa, which dates back at least 2000 year BC. Medicinal use of Mercury is mentioned (C.7.71). The use of metals as internal medicine was limited to a dosage forms known as Ayaskriti. The other two important compendias viz. Sus`hruta Samhitaa (1000 yr BC) Ast`aanga Hridaya, which was written hundreds of years later mention the medicinal use of Mercury in an increasing order. But this is as far as use of Mercury in Ayurveda is concerned; however as stated in the beginning the science of Rasas`haastra was developed as a totally independent science. This fact can be deduced from a Treatise written by Chaan`akya viz. Kout`ileeya Arthas`haastra in 3 rd century BC while the book is basically written as a collection of Guidelines for proper administration, certain factual information is revealed through its chapters. Thus while describing classification and types of Gold, Rasavedhaja gold is also mentioned. Meaning of the word Rasavedhaja is that Gold which is converted from non-precious metals with the help of Mercury. This was supposed to be the ultimate test to prove that such Mercury is able to give longevity and disease free life span to individuals. The Rasas`haastra as is known today has two definite parts. The part which is concerned with conversion of non-precious metals into precious metals with the help of specially treated Mercury was popularly known as Rasas`haastra and the other part in which properties and dosage forms and usages of Mercury and many other metals and minerals are described by which cure of many diseased conditions was possible in a small dose, was popularly known as Rasaayanas`haastra. The first was to treat Mercury so it could convert other metals into gold in progress throughout India. The researchers and scholars were mostly from different cults of Hindu and Buddhist religions like S`haakta, Kaapaalika, Mahaayaana etc. Strict secrecy and documentation, if at all it is there is found in code languages and fear imprinted on the minds of common people, these and many other factors are responsible for very little knowledge about its development. Presently we know that primary and basic knowledge of Mercury was known but how and when and where further development took place is not known. In the 3 rd century BC Chaan`akya in his treatise Arthas`haastra mentions Rasavedhaja type of Gold. This clearly indicates that the science Rasas`haastra was fully and practically developed at that time. The second part Viz. Rasaayanas`haastra which deals with methods of preparations of various drugs using metals, minerals, few animal products poisons and semi-poisons, precious and semiprecious Gemstones, oceanic products etc. started developing approximately from 1 st century AD Naagaarjuna is supposed to be the fore-founder of this part History documents the existence of different persons as Naagaarjuna, who were born in 1 st , 2 nd 4 th & 8 th centuries respectively. All of them contributed towards the development of Rasaayanas`haastra. It seems that after 1 st century AD both these sciences viz. Rasas`haastra and Rasaayanas`haastra existed together and books containing descriptions of both were written. New dosage forms were invented, tried and documented. Medicinal properties of not only Mercury but other minerals and metallic compounds, with their types were also discovered compound drugs with minerals but without mercury were invented, tried and documented. Somewhere along these developments the science Rasaayanas`haastra was linked with the science of Ayurveda. This was inevitable as terminologies to describe various ailments, their symptomatoglogies & types etc. had to be Ayurvedic as that was the only discipline of Health sciences in existence. And therefore one hardly finds mention of Dosha or their types, as well as other Rasa, Veerya, Gun`a, Prabhaava etc which are supposed to be the basic principles of Ayurveda. Gradually the science of Rasas`haastra i.e. Science of preparation of precious metals from non-precious metals, receded as the sphere of secrecy, code language and other such factors became more and more obfuscated to such an extent that it became virtually impossible to gain true and proper knowledge. The name Rasas`haastra however continued. Rasaayanas`haastra too continued to be developed up to the 10 th century but the name Rasaayanas`haastra, it appears, was forgotten and that of Rasas`haastra continued. Since the 17 th century onwards the whole world witnessed the advent of Modern materialistic sciences like Physics, Chemistry etc that definitely had an impact on Rasas`haastra. Availability, Purity, Knowledge of matter to be used for preparation of drugs based on these modern sciences, clarity about the plant products due to development of pharmacognosy etc. these and other such factors definitely change the outlook of this science. In the recent past I.e. in the 20 th century great scholars like Kaviraaja Sadaananda Sharmaa, Vaidyaraaja Yaadavji etc. even used the knowledge of modern chemistry for reclassification of drugs. Sulphuric acid, nitric acid, citric acid etc are even advocated for preparation of different drugs. Metals, which were not known, which were not discovered in the past, like Aluminum, Platinum etc. are used for preparation of Bhasma. Presently, Rasas`haastra appears to be an integrated conglomeration of Ayurveda, Rasaayanas`haastra, Chemistry including its different branches etc. All these allied modern and materialistic sciences are essential for standardizations of Rasaushadhi_s, which is of utmost importance from the point of view of documentation and research.

But the same word has different meanings in various sciences and subjects. Similarly in Aayurveda it has various different meanings according to reference. Here it is explained with reference to Dravya Gun`a Vidnyaana. It is one of the properties of Dravya and is important to know for acquiring the knowledge of its functionality. The actual term is Karman derived from root Kri meaning to do. Its literary meaning is action. It is one of the six major Kaaran`a (Means of Dhaatusaamya) are explained in Charaka Samhitaa as Saamaanya, Vis`hesha, Dravya, Gun`a, Karma and Samavaaya. 1 Definition: \u00ba\u2026\u00c6\u00aa\u2026\u2026\u2030M\u2026\u2030 S\u2026 \u00ca\u00a5\u2026\u00b6\u2026\u2026M\u2026\u2030 S\u2026 E\u02d9\u2026\u00c6h\u2026\u00c6 p\u00b8\u00a5\u00aa\u2026\u00ae\u2026\u2026\u00ca\u220f\u2026i\u2026\u00ae\u2026\u00ac * E\u02d9i\u2026\u00ab\u00a5\u00aa\u2026\u00ba\u00aa\u2026 \u00caG\u02d9\u00aa\u2026\u2026 E\u02d9\u00ae\u2026\u00ab E\u02d9\u00ae\u2026\u00ab x\u2026\u2026x\u00aa\u2026n\u00b8{\u2026\u2030I\u2026i\u2026\u2030 **52** C.Su.1 Charakaachaarya defined Karma as the action behind the Samyoga (adhesion or coming together or conjunction or union or combining or connecting) and Vibhaaga (separation or parting or deletion) of the particles of Dravya and is intimately associated with the Dravya. It inseparably resides in Dravya and is responsible for various effects / actions / resultant of that Dravya on the body after digestion. Since conjunction of one particle to other particle can not happen without separation of first particle from its former state / contact / abode Karma is said to be responsible for both. Actions in the body are subject to change with the help of adhesion and separation properties just as in the universe. 2 In Dravyagun`a, Karma is actions / effects of the drug on the body. In Ayurveda many things are called upon as Karma like procedures as in Pancha Karma, unforeseen (Adrisht`a Karma), Prayatnaadi Karma or Chesht`aa (Initiation of the act from the soul or activity) etc. but according to Dravyagun`a Vidnyaana it is considered as the property of Dravya to act upon the body by various ways. In Dravyagun`a, Karma is explained as Deepana, Paachana, Stambhana etc. which are actions of the drug on the body after its digestion. Difference between Gun`a and Karma: Gun`a and Karma are the two which are inseparably associated with Dravya. Without Gun`a Karma can not happen and depending upon the Karma or action Gun`a is identified. One can also say that Gun`a are static energy within the Dravya whereas Karma is Kinetic energy in the Dravya. 3 E\u02d9\u00ae\u2026\u00ab\u00ca\u00b6\u2026\u00bai\u00a5\u2026x\u2026\u00f7\u00ae\u2026\u00d2\u00aa\u2026xi\u2026\u2030 x\u2026\u2026x\u2026\u2026p\u00b8\u00a5\u00aa\u2026\u2026\u220f\u2026\u00aa\u2026\u2026 M\u2026\u00f7h\u2026\u2026: **514** S.Su.46  Various Karma: In Charaka Samhitaa, Charakaachaarya has enumerated 50 Karma as Mahaakashaaya. He has given 10 examples for each Karma also. 4 In Shaarngdhara Samhitaa various Karma are explained with examples these are as follows. 5 Deepana S`hatapushpaa (Mis`hi) Paachana Naagakes`hara S`hamana Amritaa (Gud`oochee) Anulomana Hareetakee Sramsana Aaragvadha (Kritamaalaka) Bhedana Kut`akee Vamana Madanaphala S`hodhana Devadaalee Phala Chhedana Kshaara, Maricha (Black peper), Lekhana Madhu (honey), Ushn`odaka (hot water), Vachaa, Yava (barley) Graahee S`hun`t`hi (dry zinzer), Jeeraka, Gajapippalee Stambhana Kut`aja, T`un`t`uka Rasaayana Amritaa, Guggulu Vaajeekaran`a Kapikachchhu Beeja etc Summary: Though Karma has various meaning in Ayurved itself, in Dravyagun`a Vidnyaana it has different meaning. It is one of the means of Dhaatusaamya. Karma is the action behind any type of adhesion or seperation. One can refer Karma as Kinetic energy of Dravya. It is different from Gun`a and Gun`a are infered by examining Karma. References: Charakasamhita by Charakacharya, Pub.

Various types of medicinal preparation are described in Rasas`haastra like Bhasma, Pisht`ee, Khalvee-Rasaayana, Parpat`ee Kaplanaa, Kupeepakva Rasaayana is one of the more important among various drug preparations. A Rasaayana product prepared from Paarada and other ingredients in a specially designed Kupee (glass bottle) with the help of Vaalukaayantra by applying specific Kramaagni Taapa (Mridu, Madhya, Teevra Agni) is known as Kupeepakva Rasaayana. Though the preparatory method of this Kupeepakva Rasaayana is supposed to be much exhaustive and complicated, it has its own significance because of specific pharmaceutical process and excellent clinical results with minimum therapeutic dosage. A] Sagandha e.g. Rasasindoora B] Nirgandha e.g. Rasapushpa, Rasakarpoora A] Kan`t`hastha  Rasasindoora B] Talastha  Suvran`a Raajvangeshvara C] Ubhayastha  Makardhvaja A] Antardhooma B] Bahirdhooma A: Sagandha: A preparation in which Gandhaka is used is called as Sagandha Kupeepakva Rasaayana e.g. Rasasindoora B: Nirgandha: A preparation in which Gandhaka is not used is called as Nirgandha Kupeepakva Rasaayana. Kan`t`hastha: A product which is obtained at the neck of the bottle is called as Kan`t`hastha Kupeepakva Rasaayana. It is also called as Sindoora Kalpanaa because of the color the final product acquires e.g. Rasasindoora Talastha: A final product which is obtained at the bottom of the bottle (Kupee) is called as Talastha Kupeepakva Rasaayana eg. Suvarn`araajavangeshvara Ubhayastha: Products which are obtained at neck and bottom also is called as Ubhayastha Kupeepakva Rasaayana e.g. Makaradhvaja Detail Description of Examples of Kupeepakva Rasaayana: Antardhooma Kupeepakva Rasaayana: In the preparation of Antardhooma Kupeepakva Rasaayana, Kramaagni should be given up to the mentioned duration, by corking of Kupee mouth initially before the starting of heating. In this preparation, there is no chance of performing completion test of Sindoora compound. It should be done very carefully as the Kupee can burst if Agni is not proper. Bahirdhooma Kupeepakva Rasaayana: In this preparation, Kramaagni should be given up to the moderate temperature, then corking of the Kupee done. Procedure: The whole procedure can be divided under three headings: A] Purvakarma B] Pradhaanakarma C] Paschaatkarma Above mentioned each and every measure taken during these three may ultimately affect the aimed goal i.e. success of the procedure. A] Purvakarma: During Purvakarma following points should be considered: Collection of appropriate equipments Purification of ingredients Preparation of Kajjalee Preparation of Kupee Filling of Kajjalee into the Kupee Collection of appropriate equipments: Kaamcha Kupee( Beer bottle- Preferably green colored bottle) Vastra (Cotton cloth) Multaanee Mit`t`i (clay) Kupee stand Vaalukaa Yantra Vaalukaa Electric muffle furnace (instead of Vaaluka Yantra) Loha S`halaakaa (iron rods) Copper coins etc. Purification of ingredients: All the ingredients should be identified first for its authenticity and purity. Purified ingredients must be tested as per the Samyak Yukta Lakshan`a described in the texts. Preparation of Kajjalee: The preparation of the ingredients should be taken as per the reference and trituration should be done without using any liquid till the mixture becomes lusterless- in a sequence as described.(disappearance of Chandrikaa). The term Kajjalee can be used for pre material or for the mixture which is used for making Kupeepakva Rasaayana Eg. Talasindoora Kajjalee, Rasapushpa Kajjalee etc. Generally the Kajjalee has appearance of black colour but still the colour of this pre material depends on the ingredients used e.g. Hinguleeya, Maan`ikyarasa Kajjalee- Red colour Rasapushpa Kajjlee - Ash colour If Bhaavana is mentioned, it should be given after the completion of Kajjalee preparation. Preparation of Kupee: It has also very important role in the successful preparation of finished product. Preparation: AIMS: Filling of Kajjalee in the Kupee: The Kupee should be filled up to the 1/3 part by Kajjalee so that there should be enough space inside the Kupee for melting and boiling of Kajjalee and also for the sublimation of compound which is going to be condensed and deposited at the neck of the Kupee. Before starting the Pradhaanakarma some intermediary precautions should be taken such as: Kupee should fix exactly at the center of Vaalukaayantra above and layer of two fingers height from the bottom of Vaalukaayantra. It includes: S`halaakaa Sanchalana- Observation of the neck and mouth of Kupee Heating pattern / schedule It has to be considered under two headings: In terms of duration of heating In terms of temperature The term duration indicates the time limit for maintenance of Kramaagni and in terms of temperature indicates the temperature limit for maintenance of Kramaagni. This heating pattern may differ in both the terms as per the individual Kupeepakva preparation but still in general it can be said that Heating pattern of Kupeepakva Rasa ii. Temperature measurement: Temperature measurement works as indicator - cotton / dried husk test rice test thermometers pyrometers (digital) iii. S`halaakaa Sanchalana: (Application of iron rods) During the procedure cold and hot iron rods are used. Cold rods (S`heeta S`halaakaa) is used especially for noting the state of Kajjalee, whether it is in powder form, melted form or in boiling stage or in sublimating compound state. While hot rod is used for burning the extra sulphur deposited at the neck region of Kupee, which may block and ultimately breaks the Kupee. iv. Preservations of fumes and flames: Fumes: All the characteristics of fumes like colour, odour etc must be noted. It differs according to the ingredients. Colour may be yellowish, Orange, bluish or white. Quantity may be mild, moderate or profuse. Odour like sulphur / aresenical odour may be some of the other observations. (Careful as they are toxic and can cause severe symtoms like headache, cough, nausea etc.) Flame: It is also an important factor which preparing Kupeepakva Rasaayana. Timing of appearance of flame its colour and its duration are the important features. These features also depend on the ingredients used. v. Corking of Kupee and self cooling: To decide the proper time of corking is very important and difficult task as well. So before corking, few tests must be done are: Here points should be noted are first there is no appearance of flame in case of Nirgandha Kupeepakva Rasaayana like Rasapushpa and Rasa Karpoora second is color of sublimating compound layer; obtained on S`heeta S`halaakaa differs according to the individual Kupeepakva Rasaayana e.g. blackish colour in Rasasindoora, white colour in Rasapushpa. Yellowish orange in Hinguleeya Maan`ikyarasa. Before corking 2-3 inches of sand layer should move aside from the neck of Kupee then corking of mouth of the Kupee should be done with mud smeared cloth. Later on it should be left for self cooling. It is supposed that during this period, forming Sindoora (sublimating compound starts to condense in the neck portion of Kupee and whatever the temperature obtaining in this period is necessary for enhancement of quantity and qualities of the Kupeepakva compound by its complete Paaka process. Pas`chaat Karma : Following measures comes under this: Removal of Kupee Breaking of Kupee Collection of product Examination of product Removal of Kupee: first sand should be removed from Vaalukaayantra and then, carefully the Kupee. Because sometimes it may be possible that Kupee is broken inside but may remain intact due to the layers of Kaapad`amit`t`i. So that the drug will not be wasted. By scrapping remove the layers of Kaapad`amit`t`i and Kupee should be cleaned with wet cloth, then mark the level of Rasaayana inside the neck or bottom Breaking of Kupee: A thread soaked in spirit should be tied around the middle of Kupee just below the level up to the adhered compound and they should be set on fire. The Kupee should be set on fire. The Kupee should be kept horizontal and rotated so that, whole thread set on fire and when it burns up completely, water should be sprinkled so that it cracks gently . Thus the Kupee will break from the middle at desired level and then Rasaayana is of Kan`t`hastha or Talastha type should be collected. Collection of product: Rasaayana product which may be Kan`t`hastha or Talastha type should be collected carefully from the particular portion of Kupee such as from neck Rasasindoora. Makaradhvaja from middle  Mallasindoora from bottomSvarn`avanga, Makaradhavaja, Samirapannaga Talastha Rasasindoora. In case of preparation on Nirgandha Kupeepakwa Rasayana heating pattern should be Kramaagni as Kajjalee and stage of flaming. In such situation corking should be done after the complete expulsion of watery vapors from Kupee and positive S`halaakaa test. Rests of the things are resembled. Medico-ethically examination of analysis of the ultimate result i.e. Rasaayana product is very essential before it is used in therapeutics. Examination of product : Examination of analytical study of finished product should be done by Physical examination study Naked eye examination Crystalline nature Colour Shining Quantity obtained Weight of the product.

Swati Gadgil, M.D. (Rasashastra) Rasas`haastra is one of the most important branches of Ayurved Rasas`haastra means Aayurvedika pharmaceutics. It mainly deals with the drugs of mineral origin and of animal origin also. Paarada and Gandhaka are the substances of great importance in Rasas`haastra. The word Rasa from Rasas`haastra itself means Paarada. As per Rasas`haastra, Paarada i.e. Mercury is said to be the most potent substance. It has all the six tastes. It balances all the three body Dosha. It becomes vehicle for all the other medicines and it is useful in treating all the diseases. All the above properties are manifested and observed only when it is mixed with some other substance i.e. in its compound form. Thus for the therapeutic purposes mercury should be used after subjecting it to Moorchhanaa process. This process is of two types: Sagandha Moorchhanaa (mercurial compounds prepared with sulphur) Nirgandha Moorchhanaa (mercurial compound prepared without sulphur) Further there are two types of each Saagni Moorchhanaa Process, which required heat Niragni MoorchhanaaProcess which doesnt require heat Parpat`ee Kalpanaa is the Sagandha Saagni Moorchhanaa. Parpat`ee is the Pot`a- Bandha of mercury. Parpat`ee Kalpanaa was first introduced in by Chakrapaan`i Dutta in the eleventh century. Parpat`ee term was derived from the word Parpat`a It means a thin brittle sheet which creates specific noise while breaking it.

S`hveta Parpat`ee Parpat`ee with sulphur but without mercury: This type of Parpat`ee contains sulphur and some other substance but no mercury. e.g. Abhra Parpat`ee, S`heetala Parpat`ee. Paaka Pareekshaa: Basic equipments required for the preparation of Parpat`ee: Stone mortar & pestle It is required for the preparation of Kajjalee from pure mercury pure sulphur and other substances like Taamra Bhasma, Loha Bhasma etc. Spoon with a long handle (Paalikaa Yantra) This spoon is called Paalikaa Yantra. Palikaa means one Pala i.e. approximately 40 gm. Thus only 40 gm is the capacity of that spoon. Its long handle should be horizontal. Generally the spoon is made up of iron or copper Spatula Spatula that is made up of iron or wood is used to move the Kajjalee which is melting in the Paalikaa Yantra. In some cases specific wooden spatulas are used e. g. In case of Grahan`ee and Atisaara spatula made from the wood of Holarrhena antidysenterica is used. Leaf Mostly Banana leaf is preferred. Two leaves are required for single preparation. One leaf is used as a base on which the melted Kajjalee is to be poured and the other one is used to cover and press the Kajjalee. If leaves of banana are not available then leaf of Nelumbo nucifera or of Calotropis procera or Ricinus communis can be used. In some preparations specific leaves are prescribed: Samput`a: Samput`a means the material used to cover the Parpat`ee from above and below. For that mainly cow dung is used. If not available buffalo dung or mud or wet cloth or floor can be used. Heat required for the preparation: Heat plays an important role in the preparation of Parpat`ee. There are some specific terms used in the texts of Rasas`haastra regarding the type of fuel, nature of heat. Preparation Procedure of Parpat`ee: Tests of Parpat`ee: Parpat`ee can be prepared in three different forms. 1. Mridu (soft) 2. Madhya (Medium) 3. Khara (Burnt) Tests to detect the forms: A) Tests carried during melting process of Kajjalee B) Tests carried after preparation of Parapt`ee. Standardization of Parpat`ee according to texts of Ayurveda: Sound specific (kat`) braking noise Touch smooth surface Taste no taste Smell smell of sulphur Cut edge straight, regular shines like silver Weight just equal to Kajjalee Shine shining Hardness hard due to immediate cooling after heating (melting) Standards set through experience If burned burns completely without leaving behind anything If rubbed with gold Absence of whiteness of gold Specifications regarding use of some Parpat`ee (Time/span): Early in the morning Vijaya Parpat`ee Bharan`ee Nakshatra Rasa Parpat`ee Three days Taamra Parpat`ee Thirty days Taamra Parpat`ee Forty days Abhra Parpat`ee Seven days - Panchaamrita Parpat`ee Twenty one days Rasa Parpat`ee Dose from 1 Gunjaa to 8 Gunjaa as per requirement Vardhamaana Parpat`ee from 1 Gunjaa to 10 Gunjaa daily (in increasing order) from 10 to 1 Gunjaa daily (in decreasing order) total 21 days Some examples of Parpat`ee quoted in Rasagrantha: Vd.

Tripathi Introduction: Cardiac diseases are one of the chronic diseases, which are getting more common in the developed countries. The first clinical symptom of this disease is Dyspnea followed by angina on exercise. Ayurveda has an edge in this field. There are several medicinal plants, which have been described as Hridya (For cardiac care) in Ayurvedic texts and one of them is Inula racemosa, which is described here. Inula racemosa Hook F. belongs to the family Compositae. Its Sanskrit Name is Pushkaramoolam, in Hindi it is Pushkaramoola or Pokharamoola and in English it is named as Oris root. Other regional names are Pushkaram, Paushkaram, Pushkara Jat`aa, Kashiram, Padmavarnakam, Moolam, Padman, Padma Patrakam, S`hvaasari, Pushkara Moola, Penva, Pokharamoola, Poshkara, Rasana, Gharsa, Pokarrumoolam (1). It is a tall, stout herb. Stem 0.3-1.5 meters high, rough, grooved, leaves leathery, rough above densely hairy beneath. Basal leaves 20-45 cms, long stalked, elliptic lance-shaped, stem leaves oblong half-stem-clasping, often deeply lobed at the base. Heads many, very large, 3.8-5 cms diameter in racemes. Outer bracts broad, tips triangular, bent back, inner bracts liner, sharp pointed. Lingules slender, 1.3 cms long. Fruit (Achene) 4cms long slender, hairless. Pappus 8 cms long reddish (2). As per the Ayurvedic text it is used as S`hvaasahara and Hikkaanigrahan`a (Charaka). Due to its Ushn`a Veerya nature, it is Kapha  Vaata S`haamaka. It possesses Gun`a as Laghu, Teekshn`a, Rasa as Tikta, Kat`u, Veerya as Ushn`a and Vipaaka as Kat`u. Pushkaramoola is very useful for Hikkaa, S`hvaasa, Hridroga, Paars`hvas`hoolaa, Hridayas`hoola, Kaasa, Kshaya, Jeern`a Jvara, S`hopha, Paan`d`u etc. as described in various classical Ayurvedic texts as given below. It is also recommended for bronchial asthma cough hiccup etc (3). Pure Phytochemical, especially steroidal compound with melting point 149-152, Daucosterol, 3 Sesquiterpine, Lactone e.g. Dihydro-Iso-Alanto-Lactone, Iso-Alantolactone (major portion) and Alantolactone have been isolated from the underground part of Inula racemosa. The last one was reported to be less toxic than other Phytochemicals (4-6). In South India, Malabar variety of Pushkaramoola is used as a substitute for the North Indian Pushkaramoola, which contains a high amount of essential oil and a group of Sesquiterpenses called Alantoides and a high yield of Octadecanoic acid, d-Maniitol, Iso-Alantolactone, and beta-Sistosterols, Glucosides were isolated from this extract, (7). It also contains Insulin 10% a volatile oil (1.3%) and Alantolactones (C 15 H 20 O 2 ) in oil (5). Pushkaramoola has been found to reduce blood sugar in rabbits with glucose induced Hyperglycemia (8). It has reported to reduce serum cholesterol (9). In rats, the petroleum ether extract of roots of I. racemosa lowered plasma insulin and glucose levels within 75 min of oral administration and it significantly counteracted adrenaline  induced Hyperglycemia in rats (10) Its alcoholic extract lowered blood glucose and enhanced liver glycogen without increasing plasma insulin in rats. There was no increase in degree of de-granulation of the beta cells of pancreas indicating its action on the target tissue, suggested that its hypoglycemic response was not due to enhanced secretion/synthesis of insulin but by enhanced insulin sensitivity (11) In similar conditions it does not show any effect on activity of adrenal gland. However the thyroid gland undergoes activation at a later stage (delayed response) 11. Other scientist has also reported the hypoglycemic effects of I. racemosa through inhibition in corticosteroid concentration 12. In a separate study it lowered the raised concentration of both cortisol and glucose in the serum and inhibits lipid-peroxidation 13. Although it was not effective in thyroid hormone meditated type II diabetes, but it enhanced the insulin sensitivity in an animal model (14, 15). The extract of Inula racemosa showed negative inotropic and negative chronotropic effects on a frogs heart showing its blocking activity for beta-Adrenergic receptors. Results were comparable with propranolol (10, 16) It showed reversal in the changed parameters of rats, where myocardial infarction was induced experimentally by isprenaline injection specially increased level of circulating GOT, LDH, CPK, CAMO, cortisol, pyruvate, lactate glucose and cardiac Camp adenyl cyclase. The results were comparable to that of ciplar, a standard beta blocker (9). It showed potential Cardio protective benefits in different human trials. With Pushkara Guggula, a ply herbal formulation, it is significantly protected the exercise induced ECG changes in a 3 months open clinical trial study on 50 patients with confirmed diagnosis of IHD with score of 10% cure, 60% with 60% relief and 20% with improved and 10% with unchanged symptoms (17-18). Another experimental study showed the prevention of ST-segment depression and T-wave inversion in the post-exercise electrocardiogram of the patients treated with Inula racemosa root powder (10,19). In combination with Commiphora mukul, it was found to be superior to that of nitroglycerin in reducing the chest pain and dysponea associated with angina (20-22). Its Aqueous and alcoholic extract showed potent ant-5-HT and antihistaminic leading to anti-allergic properties (23). It prevented the mast cell degranulation and was effective against type I hypersensitivity, viz. egg albumin induced passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) in albino rats (24) alantone (50mg/kg of the body weight daily during 30 days) has shown the increase in number and level of maturity of peritoneal and mesenteric mast cells and decreased blood clotting, thus improving the peripheral blood circulation and microcirculation (25). The alcoholic extract of the roots of Inula racemosa shoed anti-dermatophytic and cholinergic activities (26). isoalantoactone arrested the spread of human pathogenic fungi especially aspergillus flavus, A. niger, geotrichum candidum, candida tropicalis and C. albicans (6) In-vitro anti-fungal activity of alantolactone and iso-alantolactone against two ringworm fungi was reported. The response was comparable with nystain but inferior from amphotericin. alanolactone showed antihelmenthic activity against earthworms and tapeworms is an antiseptic, expectorant and diuretic (27) References: Transformation product of an Alantolactone, Tetrahendron 23, 2469-80 (1967) Reference 3-Appendix A Use of Pushkaramoola in Hridayaroga according to Ayurvedic Classics: Charaka Samhitaa Pushkaramoola is the best drug for the Paars`hva S`hoola (C.Su. 25/40) Pushkaramoola with other drugs as decoction for Hridgraha and Paars`hvas`hoola (C.Chi. 3/211  212) Pushkaramoola Along with other drugs in the form of Ghrita is useful for Vaatika pain in Hridaya and Paars`hva C.Chi. 26/83.

Different seasons exhibit varying levels of Mahaabhootas, which influence the taste of plants.

The Supreme Designer has deployed the taste and smell testing organs at the entry-point. The organs for sound, sight and touch a little away from the entry-point. The material to enter in the body is smelt first, and if the thing is safe for acceptance, it is cautiously or tentatively licked. This provides for an awareness of the taste of the substance. All beings depend on this pre-intake scrutiny for their safety, for nutritive or otherwise possibility before the final intake. In a situation when some illness is likely to approach, the choice of taste modifies. It may be exactly opposite to what is routinely accepted, for days together. As there is a natural or by treatment, recovery, the modified choice reverts for most. The choice modification and reversion, since is associated with health and disease; Ayurvedic scientists thought, taste to be the key, behind health-illness awareness and management. The instruments for this pre-intake scrutiny, are naturally programmed to discriminate for the safety of the body at that particular juncture, rather than be the same all the while. The acceptance-rejection programmed changes are just to suit the changing needs of the body. The taste smell organs are associated with each other by an inherent capability, that if required, one can safely substitute one for other. Conventionally one is (surely) aware of the sweet taste by a particular (sweet) smell, or many times one declares that a particular smell must be emanating from the taste he has come across. The environment by its cyclical rhythm of waxing and waning appearance of heat, cold, damp, exhibits modifications in taste-smells, which dominate the entire plant-kingdom. These rhythmic changing dominances, in the entire plant kingdom, reflect on the entire animal kingdom also. The animal kingdom builds relatively better strength; or otherwise loses the gained strength, capacity, naturally. The facts so far are: There is a pre-intake scrutiny Entry point location is given to taste-smell sense-organs The organs express modification, in acceptance rejection; for safety of the body at that juncture The environment exhibits a cyclical build / loss in strength, interdependent on plants and animals together. Ayurveda made it obligatory to consider interrelated smell-taste as prime scrutiny for every ingestion. They have therefore, designed the entire substance study-system, around organoleptic tests rather than analytical points. This distinct factor is to be known while the Aayu-technical terms, namely, Rasa, Veerya, Vipaaka, etc. are elaborated. As the scrutiny, of taste is followed by ingestion, the subsequent effects of that contact of the body are obtained by noting the digestion, which follows ingestion. Since the beginning is by taste, terms like the doctrine of Rasa; (Rasa-Siddhaanta) exist. Six tastes, in order of nourishing strength, are sweet (bland), sour, saline, bitter, pungent, and astringent are available in many substances. A.H.Su.1/14-15 The initial 3 of six are ameliorating Vaata, whereas subsequent 3 in 6 are against Kapha. Astringent, bitter and sweet (bland) bring down the Pitta. It is to be noted that the other remaining three are provocators for the same Dosha. A.H.Su.1/15-16 The entities available have taste(s). The Dosha_s of the body are to be restored to a balance; which can be achieved by, opting or avoiding, substances having antagonizing action on the related Dosha. Instead of expressing the analytical fractions required for the making of a substance; it is guided by noting the taste of the entity. This facilitates the actual action by all who have sense organs, and can differentiate between the tastes of available entities. The average health conscious adult chooses by this advice, the entities for and against the particular status of prevailing Dosha_s. When the imbalanced Dosha_s are so balanced, the tool of management is at the command of the individuals sense capacity. He has not to go for the gadgets or a battery of instruments. Every one has sense organs, and they give the correct signals for acceptance or rejection as specifically needed. Therefore the plea is to be sensitive in differentiating taste smells of entities, so that management can effectively be conducted. The doctrine about Rasa, and comparative potencies and their therapeutic use in respective Dosha_s are mentioned in the Sootra elaborated earlier. There are six Rasa_s, dominantly existing in the various entities of our universe. Taste understood, gives the lead for a wiser use of entities. By perception of following the tastes in the right order are known. This awareness of tastes is further compared to many aspects commonly exhibited by entities of one taste to others. The comparison about compact / loose structure interlinking or separating nature, heavy or light weight of the substance, emanation of strong odor, shape, capacity to stand by itself, fluorescent or non-shining mild colors and so on, many such observations decide whether the entity will be useful as a contribution to food, or as help to digest the nourishing food, or depleting the body ingredients. Everything of this is required in the capable management of health. By these observations the Mahaabhautic dominance can be ascertained. The balance of Dosha_s is to be achieved by comparative, superlative considerations, amongst many included in a particular taste category. When such considerations are done, different entities having a common taste can be adopted in management. The three Dosha_s viz. Vaata, Pitta, Kapha are responsible for good health if they are in equilibrium. When this is disturbed, diseases ensue. The disturbance could be in the form of hyper activity, hypo activity, precipitation or contamination. The tastes have a direct action on the Dosha activity, depending upon the variations in combinations of different proportions of Mahaabhoota_s. Taste even though classified under one category, can have distinct action due to the different proportions combining. The guideline offered by an earlier aphorism is to be considered in this perspective. To help the reader certain brief quotation are as follows: Its worth noting in here that the initial naturally formed material is carbohydrate-sugar. By availability of appropriate solar energy to plant from above and moisture by roots from below; plant cells manufacture first the sugar (in the carbohydrate form) that is the source of energy to all beings. Ayurveda has given first rank to sweet / bland taste, in consideration of materials useful for entire nourishment of all. For the purpose of sustenance, of entire animate world, the nature initiates production of sweet / (bland) Madhura taste and none else. The motivation for initial production of sweet is given by no body; so the not initiated by any one-Anaadi component leading to constancy of Ayurveda is observed in very initial energy development efforts seen in nature. After this scientific knowledge, one may understand the observations depth of Ayurveda that narrates only the end advice, than details about the origin of that advice. (Added after initial review) because of this the taste is useful to contribute to the tissues, from day one. Aajanmasaatmyaat Kurute Dhaatoonaam Prabalam Balam: Amla, Lavan`a, Tikta, Ooshan`a are sequentially less nutritive; whereas Kashaaya provides minimum. Nourishment, due to hard structure, rejection, hindrance to move ahead in the digestive tract, and no building material is available after absorption. So the selection of one, out of six tastes is not very simple, but is as intricate due to a number of associated factors. But since the sense organ makes them known, taste identity is carried forward all the while. Therefore tabular forms like the one mentioned below are the general guidelines. On one side, the taste of any entity is to be noted; and by ingesting that taste, what dominant combination of Mahaabhoota-fractions will be available as raw material to tissues, after proper absorption, is another aspect to be continuously thought of. By this taste and dominant Mahaabhautika fractions association, Ayurvedic scientists have brought in the intricate universal factors, taking part in average intake-materials, to the understanding of and examination, by common person, as by use of sense organs one is in a high level technological terms to the common person. By use of sense organs, one is in a safe position to decide and execute the choices, for newer and different situations that one comes across. The demand for intake is not the same in various phases of development or the stages of illness. An elderly responsible person at home can instruct the cook, what is appropriate for one in different situations. In the communication of choose or discard particular tastes, so many details of advice are packed together. Using the senses, instead of gadgets, or analytical instruments for advice, is of capable practical advantage. These instruments, as such, are programmed for guiding for the modifications, required for protection of the body. So the efforts of seeking reports by laboratory tests are avoided. Via tastes, the understood status of Dosha_s can be rectified, and the required Mahaabhoota-fractions can be taken in. The body possesses the necessary know-how; and there is modified demand, whenever the earlier health status is modified. The lesson of supreme teacher-nature is thus sincerely followed in taste, Mahabhoota-fractions and Dosha interrelations. Dominant Mahaabhoota fractions  Action On Dosha To facilitate such dictation, the potentials of various tastes with the context of ten pairs of (opposing) properties, in comparative superlative patterns are tabulated below: The comparative statement of ameliorating activities, potential of six tastes, or Shad`rasa_s is as follows. Chart of potential to combat respective Dosha_s by particular tastes The Mahaabhautika dominance is a lead to choose a comparative better antagonizing taste for acting against a particular property of Dosha. Thus for pacification of S`heeta of Vaata. Lavan`a-saline is best, since it has a predominance of Prithvi and Teja Mahaabhoota fractions. Amla Rasa is moderately unctuous; Ushn`a is responsible to pacify Vaatas Rooksha, S`heeta property, along with its capacity to propagate intestinal contents Anulomana, which helps to combat Vaayu due to the predominance of Aap and Teja Mahaabhoota-fractions. Thus for the pacification of Rooksha and Khara, Laghu, Chala, Gun`a of Vaata, tissues enriching Madhura sweet-bland Rasa is best due to the predominance of Prithvi and Jala Mahabhoota-fractions. Thus the order of preference for the administration of the taste substances in aggravated Vaata Dosha is Lavan`a Amla, Madhura. This formula is to be applied with proper permutations and combinations as the situation demands. Similarly for the pacification of Pitta Kapha, antagonization possible by combining Mahaabhoota-fractions should appropriately be considered. The bitter taste has the predominance of Vaayu and Aakaas`ha has Mahaabhoota-fractions. So the same is useful to pacify the fluid attribute of Pitta and also has minimal S`heeta property, which accordingly, pacifies the Ushn`a Gun`a of Pitta. Also it is very light and so it has the property of digestive refinement, of any less digested entity existing if any in part of body. This is done by activating the Pitta. The sweet bland taste has the predominance of Prithvi and Jala Mahaabhoota fractions. It is unctuous and heavy to digest, properties are useful to pacify Pitta and easy to digest, and irritating, penetrating, and fermenting attributes of Pitta, along with the moderate cold, and it pacifies the heat generating quality. Astringent taste facilitates the residual fluidness and absorption of Pitta. Its maximum dry desiccative nature along with moderate heaviness balances the lightness of Pitta. Thus the order of preference for the administration of entities in aggravated Pitta Dosha is bitter, sweet-bland, astringent, taste abundant substances. Also in the Kapha Dosha aggravation, as pungent is dominant combine of Teja and Vaayu; it is useful for pacification of cool, unctuous, heavy, and fine smooth characters of Kapha. Pungent is Ushn`a and moderate dry and light. Bitter has the maximum light quality and minimal dry desiccating, to help in pacifying the heavy, fluid richness of Kapha, due to the predominance of Vaayu and Aakaas`ha Mahaaabhoota fractions. Astringent has maximum dryness helps in the absorption of residual fluid and unctuousness of aggravated Kapha. Thus the order of preference for the administration of the entities in aggravated Kapha Dosha is pungent, bitter and astringent. The entire tastes as elaborated by Aayu-scientists and have the support of the plant-kingdom. There are cyclical, global, rhythmic observations about naturally dominating tastes in the entire plant-products. The aggregate yield in plant products modifies according to manifestations of Mahaabhautika waxing and waning in particular locations. It may be stated that the rains (appearance of Jala), sunshine (Tejas), and movement potential responsible for tides, clouds, celestial entities, earthquakes etc. (Vaayu) are seasonal, so far as the entire globe is concerned. But plants get them only when they are in and around the plants have them. All the animals can have the chance of nutrition only if these Mahaabhautika components make their appearance in the vicinity, instead of remote areas. Also the seasonal changes, generally observed in that proper location, basically modify, the availability of air, water, and plant foods for the living beings. There, it must be noted that carnivorous animals are dependant for nourishment on herbivorous animals i.e. their prey-food. The statement therefore is made, that the nutrition of all, is solely dependant on the appearance of Mahaabhoota_s in that location. Otherwise the entire population is at risk. Out of five, three are more active, and therefore are of more concern. Prithvi and Aakaas`ha do not wax or wane, as is the vacillation of Jala, Teja, Vaayu. The location specific magnitude of Mahaabhoota_s, if and when, does not make its usual appearance; then dominance of malnutrition, disease and death is certain. By centuries long observations, oriental and Ayurvedic seers have associated environmental, meteorological divisions, to:- More or less appearance of Mahaabhoota_s by: Noting moisture interlinked with dust rich soil, Availability of safe potable water in abundance or scarcity pattern; Persistence of heat or cold spells; The periods of plants, with rich foliage or denuded foliage, by fall of leaves and shrinkage of other plant components. The coverage by the entire plant kingdom of the land or ground is indicator of the forest cover quality of Prithvi Persistence of rains, flowing streams of water and moist soil is an indicator of good / better appearance of Jala Persistence of long spells of hot temperature with perspiration and exhaustion prevalence; is indicator of appearance of dominant Tejas Withering away of the plants, by turning the plant dry, yellow-dark, parched, light, instead of turgidity and heaviness, is indicator of dominant Vaayu, it can equally be so by frequent occurrence of storms, cyclones, earthquakes breaking away all the useful interlinks. This is the abrupt indicator of Vaayu By progress of degeneration, drying, when silently the plant-parts coverage is lost, it is an indicator of Aakaas`ha in excess. The various seasons by themselves exhibit the characters comparable to excesses, have one or the other Mahaabhoota in nature. As a result of excess appearances of Mahaabhautika characters the welfare of beings is at risk. The plant products, if available at other locations, need be used for the survival of the animal population. Here is a table of names, and main characteristic given to the divisions of seasons, prevalent in India. The sun moves either to the north or to the south; though every day it rises in east and sets in the west. The movement towards north takes away abundant water from the total environment whereas southward movement period allows entry or retention of water in the plants environment. This is responsible for the availability of less or more Mahaabhautika components to plants in an environment. The different contribution from them is responsible for dominance of one taste, in the plant kingdom. This observation about taste of majority plants and associated characters of five Mahaabhootas dominance, has led to understand the fractions from Mahaabhoota_s contributing to the structure of each taste. It gives; the tastes attuned to each and every season, and characteristically noted dominance of [within favorable limits] Mahaabhoota_s. Due to this dominance the ascribed taste of the division, and the rationale of the actually prevalent tastes in the majority of all plants can be understood. This leads to application of waxing and waning concept of proportion of Mahaabhoota_s, in areas of the world, where there are less or more hot cold, damp-dry dominances, to modify the local seasons than the Indian subcontinent. The concept of tastes being contributed by fractions of Mahaabhoota_s; is based upon multiple observations of substances, and environmental factors favorable for yield of that taste in plants. It needs to be taken as a collective, rather a single happening. The sweet bland substances possess, compact rounded figures naturally. In small dimension they have more weight. When crushed or ground they yield expanded size of pulp or flour. The natural tendency for this growth is by accommodating in a small area and further these plants have the capacity to grow erect. The plant does not crack due to flexible architecture. It is relatively soft, facilitating easy mastication. The sour substances are liquid or moist, and are never rigid or hard. It is not easy to dry them. The plants yielding sour for the most part are not very big, tall or have a hard stem. Usually a little thorny pattern is there. The leaves are not of grass pattern, but attached to the stem by a joint. Plants that originate saline tasty substances are limited. It has a stem, usually with a torque and stout pricking thorns. Vegetable latex is rich in salinity. It is thicker than sour juices. It is initially of white color till the water portion evaporates. Majority of sour juices have a yellow, red color. Saline taste yielding plants are of short stature and thick leaf-architecture. They thrive better in less rain as opposed to the sour yielders. The bitter substances are hollow from within, and are light in weight. Crushing or grinding yields smaller volume, with weeping juice, thin in substance. They easily disintegrate. The plants yielding bitter occupy big area, at times needing support to stand erect. Pungent is the lightest in weight and can be packed in a small volume. There is no juice and can be ground easily. It is usually of high bright color and penetrating odor. The volume after grinding is much smaller. The plants yielding pungent have a very weak stem and stalk is also weak. Unless support and protection is available they do not rise above ground level. Astringent material is hard to crack, dense in architecture, disintegrates leaving more volume of flour. The juice is less but a thick paste can be seen. It is devoid of sticky nature as compared to the sweet one, the plants yielding astringent taste are considerably stout and tall. They surpass the other plants by better fuel qualities too. The stalks, leaves, branches are widespread but strong. The entire description will lead one to Mahaabhoota_s contributing in the formation of tastes. After perusal of these observations in nature and that of taste rich substances; certain other features of entire cycles repeatedly seen need to be considered. Rainy days facilitate innumerable sprouts in germinating seeds in agricultural or natural (prepared) soil. The taste of the sprouting material in environment is sour. The risk of milk turning abruptly acidic is maximum in this hot, moist climate. It is noted by science that due to the combination of aerial nitrogen with moisture from clouds, due to the thunder stimuli, the rainwater turns acidic. The Varshaa-initial stormy rainy spell is of sour taste compared to the later rainy days. Post rainy day spell is of progress and nutritive addition to the plant components, before maturity. Maturity brings nutrition rich sweet / bland taste, whereas the pre-maturity exhibit salty taste in plants. The plant kingdom produces a number of bright colored flowers, readily rich in pollen. They initiate many conditions where itching and reddish changes in the complexion of skin is the main feature. The sky is rich in red, orange, yellow, crimson colors at dawn or dusk, and this specific character of season is due to the transient dominance of Tejas. Water evaporates from the muddy areas and that exposed to sunshine changes to whitish salt dominated surface. Noting all these factors the taste of post rainy-season period is ascertained as saline. As the natural plant progress reaches maturity, the earlier saline modifies to a more nourishing sweet / bland taste. This is substantially noted by better nourishment capabilities seen in all fodder for animals than in any other season, the environment favors better digesting capacities, no exhaustive perspiration, safe potable water within easy reach and easier nutrition material. All these suggest that there is a prevalence of the sweet taste. Beyond this plush season is the severe cold spell. It demands more nutrition to survive. The environment however, does not provide that abundant easily available nutritive food, water gets scarce day by day. The coverage of ground by foliage decreases due to cold, the plants getting dry, shrunk, and parched losing moisture day by day. The animals start losing strength, as supply is less than the demand. The unattended nourishing entities turn bitter, instead of sweet. The dominance of bitter is thus exhibited in the background of the plush season during autumn. As the cold retreats the denuded trees manifest newer foliage, which is of an astringent taste. The outer skins of barks develop cracks. Their taste too is astringent. In nature there is progressive shrinkage everywhere. No interlinking or long lasting growth is noted. In spring the coverage is comparatively limited to plant population as compared to that seen in the rainy season. As water gets more scarce it is limited. The astringent is the taste of the Vasanta season. The scorching hot summer is with the least coverage by the plant kingdom; dry, dusty, no water for miles, temperature high enough to decrease digesting and the general body capacity all the way, nutritive food or, drinking safe water is scarce, resulting in depletion of existing tissues. Separation in place of interlinking is the feature, justly simulating the pungent taste. The plant part by continuous desiccation by heat, turn irritant. Basil leaf tasted during this season is very pungent. If nature is observed very carefully, collective dominance causes an effect on all beings that are dependant on naturally available plant products of that area. In the recent past communication has avoided this risk by transportation, from other areas. However animals still run the risk. Seasons can be classified to have the dominance of two Mahaabhoota_s or no dominance of others. When Prithvi Jala, are dominant, it will help the building of tissues; whereas availability of Tejas, Vaayu, Aakaas`ha will decrease the existing tissues. The needs of the body are distinct in different physiological / pathological situations, the average live person can adopt the program of choosing Mahaabhautika dominance taste of materials, and the best technical information is available to persons without the use of a gadget. This is the greatest advantage of the comprehension of the Rasa Siddhaanta.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "905c0a69-10d2-4ee4-a4f4-a10ea0920772": {"__data__": {"id_": "905c0a69-10d2-4ee4-a4f4-a10ea0920772", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"tag": "p", "file_path": "/home/dai/rag/data/clean_html/Articles/Dravya-Rasabhaishajya/Rasopalabdhi.htm", "file_name": "Rasopalabdhi.htm", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 5790, "creation_date": "2024-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-14", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-15", "summary": "**Summary of Ayurveda's Rasa (Taste) Theory:**\n\nRasa, or taste, is a fundamental concept in Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine. It refers to the different tastes that drugs, minerals, and food possess, which can be sensed by the tongue.\n\n**Formation of Rasa:**\n\nAyurveda believes that the universe and everything in it, including Rasa, are composed of five basic elements known as Pancha Mahaabhoota: Prithvi (earth), Jala (water), Agni (fire), Vaayu (air), and Aakash (ether). Rasa is formed when these elements interact in specific proportions.\n\n**Types of Rasa:**\n\nSix primary Rasas are recognized in Ayurveda:\n\n1. **Madhura (Sweet)**\n2. **Amla (Sour)**\n3. **Lavana (Salty)**\n4. **Katu (Pungent)**\n5. **Tikta (Bitter)**\n6. **Kashaya (Astringent)**\n\n**Dominant Elements in Rasa Formation:**\n\nThe dominant elements in the formation of each Rasa are:\n\n* Madhura: Prithvi and Jala\n* Amla: Agni and Jala\n* Lavana: Agni and Prithvi\n* Katu: Vaayu and Agni\n* Tikta: Aakash and Vaayu\n* Kashaya: Vaayu and Prithvi\n\n**Rasanirvritti and Rasopalabdhi:**\n\nRasanirvritti refers to the specific mode of formation of each Rasa, while Rasopalabdhi is the process of identifying and experiencing the taste of a substance.

Tongue is called as Rasanaa or Rasanendriya as it identifies the different tastes. Rasa is the object of the gustatory sense organ. Rasa is not an independent object. Rasa is located and present in each, substance whether herbal drug, mineral drug or food. The object, which is sensed and perceived with the help of Rasanendriya, is called as Rasa. In the Charaka Samhitaa we find discussions about the number of Rasa_s. From infinity to an affixed number. Finally only six numbers of Rasa_s are fixed. They are Madhur  -  Sweet taste Amla -  Sour taste Lavan`a -  Salty taste Kat`u  -  Hot taste Tikta -  Bitter taste Kashaaya -  Astringent taste Ayurveda considers that every particle in the universe is made up of the Pancha Mahaabhoota_s. Rasa are also made up of these five basic elements, which contribute in the formation of each body. The object Rasa is perceived by the tongue, that is Rasanendriya. Rasanendriya is mainly made up of the dominance of Jalamahaabhoota; hence it perceives Rasa of each and every matter. Rasa or taste is manifested by the dominance of Jalamahaabhoota and Prithvimahaabhoota. Thus these two Mahaabhoota_s are the main contributors in the formation of Rasa or taste. This specific mode of formation of Rasa_s is named as Rasanirvritti that is the formation of Rasa or taste. So for the formation of each Rasa, Jala and Prithvi Mahaabhoota_s are necessary. But in the formation of each Rasa, the percentage and proportion of Mahaabhoota_s is different. This concept is named as Rasavis`hesha. Due to this difference in the proportion of Mahaabhoota_s, the actions of Rasa differ. Thats the reason for the difference between the actions of every Dravya. Rasa_s are located in the Dravya_s. Lokpurusha Siddhaanta is an important phenomenon which states that whatever exists in the universe exists in the human body also. Rasa are contributed by Pancha Mahaabhoota_s. But considering the action of Rasa on the human body every Rasa is composed of two Mahaabhoota_s or only two Bhoota_s take part in the composition of each Rasa. They are composed during specific seasons in the universe according to the predominance of Bhoota_s. For example: Rasa Mahaabhoota Season Madhura Prithvi+Jala Hemant Amla Agni+Jala  Varshaa Lavan`a Agni+Prithvi  S`harada Kat`u Vaayu+Agni Grishma Tikta Aakas`ha+Vaayu  S`his`hira Kashaaya Vaayu+Prithvi  Vasanta These are the Bhoota_s contributing in the formation of Rasa_s and the seasons in which they are formed. Rasa_s are mainly derived from Aapamahaabhoota. The base of the formation of Rasa_s is Aapa Mahaabhoota. According to the seasons, the dominating Mahaabhoota takes part in the formation of Rasa. Though Rasa_s are Paanchabhautik and derived from Aapamahaabhoota, two Mahaabhoota_s dominatingly contribute in their formation. Bhautika dominance of these two, contributing in Rasa_s, is also different. As in Tikta Rasa, Vaayu is more predominating than in Kat`u Rasa. Agni dominates over Vaayu in formation of Kat`u Rasa. This predominance in the composition of Rasa between the two Mahaabhoota_s is identified on the basis of action of the Rasa_s observed when they come in contact with Rasanendriya that is the tongue. This contact between tongue and Rasa is called Nipaata. The type of Rasa and its properties are identified by this Nipaata. There are specific symptoms of each Rasa called Lakshan`a. This Lakshan`a is felt after Nipaata. Rasa Lakashan`a: With the help of the above-mentioned symptoms we can identify the Rasa of each Dravya. This specific concept of identification of taste is named as Rasopalabdhi in Ayurveda.

Vilas Nanal AVP Dravya The Ayurvedic management of diseases can be divided into two main categories i.e. the S`hodhana Chikitsaa and the S`hamana Chikitsaa. The former has been praised by all the ancient authors since it eliminates the vitiated Doshika matter by removing the bulk of it physically out of the body mainly through the external orifices and rendering the Doshika matter ineffective, thereby reducing the chance of recurrence of disease to a minimum. The other modality of disease management is to be ideally employed only after the former has been administered successfully or when the condition of the patient makes it impossible to employ S`hodhana. The S`hamana methods convert the vitiated Doshika matter to a form, which is nonirritant. Non-obstructing the Srotasa_s without getting it out of the system. Hence the chances of recurrence of the same disease entity are more in this treatment. It would be only logical to sequentially list the various stages that are involved in any S`hodhana Upakrama they are as under: 1.Poorvakarma: 2. Pradhaanakarma: 3. Paschaatkarma: The selection of the patient is also important. The physician has to diligently evaluate the person using the ten parameters viz. Dushya, Des`ha, Bala, Kaala etc. Then based on his findings the appropriate Karma is selected. The Sneha Dravya is chosen and its mode of administration i.e. internal as well as external is decided. The period, remain flexible subject to the Samyak Snigdha Lakshan`a_s. The Svedana is affected after Snehana. These two stages of the Poorvakarma are essential. The Snehana Dravya_s (substances capable of causing Oleation) have the following attributes. Drava: fluidity, capacity to penetrate and occupy the smallest space of the internal environment Sara: capability of initiating movement of the bodily elements along their proper pathways Snigdha: oily, unctuous and capable of facilitating free movement of various bodily elements by eliminating friction Pichchhila: slimy, sticky, does not give but tends to give off fine threads, important in the process of healing of wounds Guru: heavy (on Agni) S`heeta: cold to touch and effect (cold phase activity) Manda: sluggish Mrudu: supple, yielding rendering the internal environment loose, manageable Owing to these properties the Snehana Dravya when administered in a large amount, both internally as well as externally, tends to annihilate the vitiated Vaayu by countering the Vaayu properties and then leaves the internal environment more supple, non-conducive to accumulation of vitiated Dosha_s. Dhaatu_s do not harbor the Dosha_s, hence they resemble water plants, which are floating freely along the current, and ready to be carried away if and when a sharp object severs the thin band that holds it to the main body. Hence when Oleation is adequate the Dosha_s leave their anchor easily without damaging the delicate tissues. The Svedana Dravya_s (substances capable of sudation, fomentation, sweating) have the following attributes: Ushn`a: hot to touch and effect (hot phase activity), should induce sweating Teekshn`a: intense, sharp, cutting, irritant Sara: capability of initiating movement of the bodily elements along their proper pathways Snigdha: oily unctuous and capable of facilitating a free movement of various bodily elements by eliminating friction Rooksha: dry, rough, intensifying the Agni and Vaayu activity and indirectly causing Svedana Sookshma: subtleness, capacity to penetrate and occupy the smallest space of the internal environment Drava: as above Sthira: steady, resists movement, conversion Guru: as above In a body saturated with Sneha and rendered turgid, Utkles`hana is administered to further increase the Doshika matter and bring it to the point of spill out of the As`haya or Srotas. Many times patient is surprised by the advise to take the items prohibited for management, for long times. If a clever hunter wishes to bring the tiger with in the reach of gun, possessing gun and bullet is not sufficient. There should be a bait, to which tiger hidden in the deep of forest, will be tempted to catch, by being with in the range of fire. The Utkles`hana items attract the Dosha_s deep in tissues to hollows of organs. Such large bulk, temporarily attracted can be thrown out by suitable secretion promoting doses, the main stimulus for achieving elimination. C.Si.1/7-8 Pradhaana Karma The S`hodhana Dravya (substances capable of removing the vitiated Doshika matter physically out of the body through the external orifices) has the following attributes Ushn`a due to this property the S`hodhana Dravya further liquefies the Doshika matter from the subtle S`haareera Paramaan`u (body cells) Teekshn`a Due to this property the S`hodhana Dravya is capable of reaching the site of the disease manifestation without undergoing the process of digestion. Hence the action of these substances begins from the tongue itself. Vikaasee Due to this property the S`hodhana Dravya is capable of creating space, separating the adhesions at Sandhi and Marma without damaging them. The latter two properties enable the S`hodhana Dravya to reach the Hridaya and the site without losing time and carryout their actions. This is possible because of the Praana Vaayu, Bodhaka Kapha, and Rasa Dhaatu. The former two properties go through a regular process of Kledana and S`hoshan`a from the Mahaasrotasa and are carried to the Hridaya. This transportation is a result of the interaction between the Praan`a and Samaana Vaayu. These are Agni sent to the site of their action by way of Rasa Dhaatu and Vyaana Vaayu. On reaching the site, which is turgid and full of Dosha, ready to ooze out. The action of the former two properties begins. The Dosha is separated from the Rasa and is dislodged from the site if vitiation through either the gross Aas`haya_s or the subtle Srotas. This dislodged Dosha intermingles with the circulating Rasa and is brought back from the Naabhi to the Hrudaya. From Hrudaya to the appropriate site in the Mahaasrotasa viz. Aamaas`haya, Pachyamaanaas`haya or Pakvaas`haya. This process of rendering the Dosha liquid and loose is termed as Vishyanda is due to the Ushn`a property. The process of cutting loose the Dosha is termed as Chhedana is due to the Teekshn`a property. This liquefied and separated Dosha intermingles with the Rasa, but it cannot mix or dissolve in it because the whole internal environment is saturated with the previously administered Sneha. This Dosha floats on the periphery of the lubricant from the inside and does not permit water to accumulate within; similarly the body also does not permit accumulation of Dosha within. Each An`u (molecule) of the vitiate, floating Doshika matter is selectively reabsorbed in Mahaasrotas. If the S`hodhana Dravya were Agni-Vaayu predominant it would accumulate in the Aamaas`haya and would result in Vamana. Similarly if the S`hodhana Dravya was Prithvi Jala predominant it would accumulate in Pachyamaanaas`haya and would result in Virechana. This re-absorption by each An`u is termed as An`upravan`a Bhaava and the free-floating movement of the Dosha in the Rasa is termed as Pariplava. Hence now it would be apparent from the foregoing discussion that the S`hodhana Dravya_s acts in two-fold manner on coming in contact with the body. Firstly from the tongue itself it starts being Rasagaami due to their Vyavaayi and Vikaasi properties. On reaching the site of the disease they enter the affected S`haarira Paramaan`u, begin their role of generating space by liquefying the occluding Doshika matter, cutting it loose from its attachment. The second stage is their sequential Kledana, Iran`a from the Mahaasrotas to the Rasaayani_s, their carriage to Hridaya and from there to the site of disease by following the three fold movement of Rasa along the Rogamaarga_s and on reaching the target the action is compounded, thereby giving rise to a Paramaan`u which is very turgid and ready to offload its liquid contents into the Rasa-Kleda which carries it to the Naabhi to be carried to the Hridaya and finally from there it is carried to the appropriate site in the Mahaasrotas to be removed out of the body. This circular movement of the S`hodhana Dravya_s, is facilitated by the previous Snehana and Svedana in adequate measure. Thus the internal friction is eliminated and the internal environment is supple thereby the chances of injury to the delicate inner lining (Kalaa_s) are negligible. But if the Poorvakarma are short of the needed (Heena yoga) or done in excess (Ati yoga) or done improperly (Mithyaa yoga) then the Vyaapatti_s (complications) set in which can be of very grave consequences) These stages of the action of S`hodhana Dravya_s can be studied as under: The Paschaat Karma. This is essential to render the internal environment non-conducive for accumulative Doshika activity, thereby reducing the chance of recurrence of the same disease to a minimum. The Agni (gastric fire) carries out its functions in a fluid state and in administration of S`hodhana Upakrama_s. The body fluids are lost in a substantial amount, thereby leaving Agni ineffective, weak; unable to digest the food ingested, if it is not rekindled then recurrence is a certainty. The fluid, which was lost, has to be replaced by following a sequential procedure called as the Samsarjana Krama. In this procedure the patient is initiated on dietary regimen with: From the foregoing discussion the healing action of the S`hodhana Dravya_s is apparent. They have a twofold action from the point and moment of entry, at the site of disease, their return to the Mahaasrotas via the Hridaya and their final action of S`huddhi Prakriyaa. Vaidya.

Also Dangerous Drug Act, 1930 and Poisons Act 1919 define drug related policies. These acts and related rules regulate export, manufacture, distribution and sale of drugs and cosmetics. Considering increase in demand, use and export of drugs from Ayurvedic and other systems included in AYUSH; Government of India has specified the rules and notifications related manufacturing, standardization and other aspects of drug usage. Ayurvedic, Unani and Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeias published by the Govt. of India have prescribed various standards to be followed for ISM & Homoeopathic drugs. In 2002 Govt. of India published Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) guidelines to guide the drug analysts in maintaining high scientific and professional standards for ensuring only drugs of the highest quality are produced and marketed. In 2003, government issued notification of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) to ensure authentic, contamination free quality raw material, manufacturing process and product with desired quality standards. Guidelines for Quality Control Standards for quality control are based on pharmacognostic, physicochemical, phytochemical and biological parameters. General process and parameters employed in present standardization of herbal drugs is described below.

It includes also their history, nomenclature, cultivation and collection, and other particulars relating to the treatment they receive during their passage from the producer to the distributor or pharmacist (Wallis, 1967, p.4). The name pharmacognosy is derived from the Greek, pharmakon, a drug and gignosco, to acquire knowledge of (trease, 1996, p.3) It is closely related to both botany and plant chemistry. As late as the beginning of the present century, pharmacognosy had developed mainly on the botanical side, being particularly concerned with the description and identification of drugs both in its original form and in a powder form. Later with the rapid development of plant chemistry and pharmacology, more attention was given to these aspects. The latest trends are towards the bio-chemical aspect rather than the botanical aspect because, in modern medicine, drugs are being used in their most active constituent forms. Ayurvedic materia-medica consists of crude drugs mainly of vegetable origin. The Ayurvedic pharmacology and therapeutics is based on crude drugs and not on their active principles. So the conventional concept of pharmacognosy, which has mainly been concerned with the botanical aspect, still holds importance and it is an essential study for the correct identification and standardization of drugs in Ayurvedic materia medica. In short the main idea is to correlate an Ayurvedic drug, mainly plants, with its botanical identity i.e. with the proper Latin Binomial / Trinomial. This can be achieved with the help of Samskrita (Classical names and traditions. Again, these identities are confirmed with the help of Gun`a, Karma (properties, actions and uses) as ascribed in classical literature and also made available from ethno-botanical surveys. This is essential for standardizing and Globalising the use of Ayurveda. The importance of the correct identification of drugs was well realized by the Ayurvedic Rishi_s thousands of years back. It is evident from the verses mentioned in Charaka. The phamacognosist is known as Naamaroopadnya which means he is well versed with the Naama (various synonyms of the drug) and the Roopa (physical and other characteristics) by which the drug is identified. People in their primitive days resided in the vicinity of jungles and were well acquainted with plants regarding their identity. They paid more attention to study their actions and uses and as such a well-developed material Medica was evolved. There was no need for a descriptive vocabulary for giving a morphological picture of plants. Single names were used for drugs. It is evident from the example of Kus`ha and Darbha. These names were derived in Samskrita according to the morphological characters of the rhizomes. In Kus`ha, rhizomes go deep in the soil, and in Darbha they bind the soil extensively by their creeping underground parts. Exactly the same meaning is depicted by the Samskrita root words from which these names are derived the trend to describe a drug with other synonyms started in the Samhitaa period, but to a limited extent. They advocated that the identification of drugs should be studied from fieldwork with the help of shepherds, cowherds, sages and those who dwelt in jungles. This still holds good and many controversial drugs have identified with the help of local tribal names and transmitted through generations and not much polluted with the passage of time (Singh, 1972, XII). As the mode of life changed gradually from jungles to rural and urban surroundings, contact with nature gradually decreased. In the absence of workable morphological descriptions of plants a vocabulary was developed in Samskrita to describe the drugs in such concise and precise words, which would be suitable to be included in verses, which was the prevalent mode of writing in the olden days. These synonyms may be taken as the basis of Ayurvedic pharmacognosy. These names are very expressive and appropriate and are based on physical appearance or morphology, similarity or resemblance with some other popularly known object, place of origin, habitat, time when it was found, properties, uses in certain diseases, special circumstances in which they are employed, or bear the name of some god or goddess or an epic hero, or are connected with some Pauran`ic legend or religious rite. This has been well illustrated by Majumdar (1927, p 71-78), Harshe (1952, Introduction to Shivakosha, p.6-12), Bapalal (1968, Vol. I & 1984, Vol. II) and Dwiwedi (1970, p. 69-81). Sharma (2000) has tried to prove the identity of 150 plants on the basis of synonyms, which is quite a new presentation. Pandey (1997) has enumerated about 25000 names classified into 57 groups on different aspects and has given the root meanings of about 600 plant names. Shastri (2001) has made available the etymology of 498 plants along with 2000 synonyms. All these efforts are mainly based on Samskrita grammar and personal observations. The vocabulary of plant names in Ayurveda is so vast (more than 1900 words in Brihattrayee-Singh and Chunekar, 1972, p. IX) that by itself it will form a subject for a large book as referred above and it will be improper to treat it in a few pages. Prior to these, many Samskrita lexicographers and their commentators have tried to explain the root meanings of many synonyms without having any practical experience of the field study. Mostly they have explained the meanings based on properties and uses though these words depict some special character for identifying the drug. However, a few examples are given below to get an idea about the vastness and importance of the subject. Basis of nomenclature of drug names in Ayurveda: 1.Morphology: Root    I. S`hatamulee (many roots) for S`hataavaree (Asparagus Racemosus Willd.) (Plate 1) II.Bahupaada (many prop roots like legs) for Vat`a (Ficus Bengalensis) Linn). Bark - I. Tanutvak (thin bark) for Cinnamonum Zeylanicum Blume. Stem - II.Trivruta (three winged stem) for Operculina Turpethum (Linn) Silva Manso. (Plate 2) Leaf - I.

Historical background: Bodhidruma (being related to Nirvaan`a of Buddha under it) for Ficus Religiosa Linn (Plate 15) Apart from these, there are many names related to different animals, familiar scenes and happenings in the daily life of the community. Not only the external appearance but certain internal structures and some special characteristics were taken into consideration for developing the vocabulary of synonyms. A few examples are cited below: Chakralakshan`ikaa (transverse section of stem shows structure of a wheel) for Tinospora Cordifolia (Willd.) Miers. Chitratand`ulah (Seed coat looks of variegated color) for Embelia ribes Burm.f. Mandukaparn`i  This synonym not only indicates the similarity of the leaves of Centella asiatica (Linn) Urban with the frog but also indicates the habit (runner) of the plant, which is similar to the hopping of the frog. Some synonyms (Roodhi (traditional)-Naama) cannot be explained on the basis of their root meanings and are conventionally accepted as they are. It is possibly due to our ignorance of the basic concept on which those names were coined for a particular object. Though these names are very helpful for the identification of drugs, they have certain drawbacks as well. Being based on certain common characters one name is applicable to other drugs also. Similarly many names were used (required) to describe a particular drug and hence these different names and their distorted forms in different parts of our country are in routine practice to know a single drug. This has created the group of Controversial drugs in Ayurveda to a certain extent. The problem was well understood by the Ayurvedists and they advised a specification of a drug only after full scrutiny of all the available information and study of the physical characters including the group characters also. Moreover a correct interpretation of these synonyms is essential. Only the knowledge of Samskrita is not sufficient. It requires a thorough combined knowledge of Botany, Ayurveda and Samskrita. In this connection I would like to point to the interpretation of Tarkaari as vegetable by an eminent Samskrita Lexicographer, Harshe (1952, p.XI) in his Introduction to Shivakosha. Shivadatta is correct to a certain extent in equating Vahnimantha with Tarkaari, though it is an allied drug, Clerodendrum Phlomidis Linn f. (Singh and Chunekar, 1972, p. 175), but certainly it is not vegetable. Similarly the synonym S`hookasimbaa as one of the names relating to a parrot is not correct. It is a synonym of Mucuna Prurita Hook, where the pods (S`himbee) are covered with bristles like hairs (S`hooka), which cause the itching. Originally, the synonyms, which were formed in the Samskrita language, were quite appropriate for a particular drug. In a vast country like India, with limited resources in communication, during olden days, it was natural that different substitute drugs with similar properties came into use for a particular drug of Samhitaa. Synonyms suitable to each of these drugs were formed separately by scholars who wanted to describe the drug, which they were using. Later some compilers who were table-writers, without paying any attention to field study, composed Samskrita verses including all the synonyms prevailing for the particular drug name though these were coined for different plant sources. This fact is well illustrated with an example of Murvaa by Singh (1955) and Singh and Chunekar (1972, p. 315) where the list of synonyms mentioned in Nighan`t`u_s for Murvaa includes such names, which are not applicable only to the real Murvaa (Marsdenia Tenacissima W. & A.) but also to other plant species Viz., Sansevieria Roxburghii Schult, Bauhinia Vahlii W. &A Maerua Arenaria Hook f.&Th., Clematis Gouriana Roxb., Chonemorpha Macrophylla G. Don. Etc .Not only the nomenclature, but also all aspects of botany, agriculture including taxonomy, collection, cultivation, storage etc. are referred to in Ayurveda and other old disciplines (Majumdar, 1927, Yadavji, 1950 Sharma 1955, 1956, I, II) But it now requires supplementation from advancements made in different scientific fields of the 21 st century. This is the most essential feature for standardizing Ayurvedic drugs. Plate 1. Asparagus Racemosus Willd Plate 2. Operculina Turpethum (Linn) Silv Manso Plate 3. Datura Metel Linn Plate 4.

Veerya is believed to be the driving force behind the actions and effects of drugs in the body.\n\nAccording to Ayurveda, Veerya can be classified into two main types: Ushna (hot) and Sheeta (cold). Ushna Veerya drugs are believed to have warming and stimulating effects, while Sheeta Veerya drugs are considered cooling and soothing.\n\nThe determination of Veerya is based on various factors, including the taste, physical qualities, and chemical composition of the drug. For instance, sweet-tasting drugs are generally considered to have Sheeta Veerya, while pungent-tasting drugs are typically associated with Ushna Veerya.\n\nAyurvedic texts describe eight different types of Veerya, each with its unique properties and effects. These types include Snigdha (unctuous), Rooksha (dry), Vishada (non-slimy), Pichchhila (slimy), Sheeta (cold), Ushna (hot), Mridu (soft), and Teekshna (sharp).\n\nVeerya is considered an important factor in determining the therapeutic effects of drugs. For example, Ushna Veerya drugs are often used to treat conditions associated with cold and sluggishness, while Sheeta Veerya drugs are employed to address conditions characterized by heat and inflammation.\n\nResearch on Veerya has explored its potential effects on various physiological systems, including the skeletal muscle, heart muscle, and metabolism.

This comprehensive term is employed to explain lesser or greater potential factors, in the drug in relation to different processes and procedures to achieve the desired effect in the body. The Ayurvedic principles of drug action have been described in the form of Rasa, Gun`a, Veerya, Vipaaka and Prabhaava. If these are the principles through which the drug operates, the word Veerya, then, should also be used for actions due to Rasa, Vipaaka, Gun`a and Prabhaava. As Prabhaava could not be rationally and practically proved, it was put into the category of empirical treatment and as the other four could be rationally and practically demonstrated, they were put in another group. Right in the beginning Veerya was divided into two groups; Chintya or calculable Veerya and Achintya or non-calculable from available information. Chintya Veerya indicates Veerya in general and Achintya Veerya indicates Prabhaava. According to the various Sanskrit dictionaries and (Kos`ha_s) it is apparent that the word Veerya is derived from the grammar root Veer or Vri meaning Vikranti or specific power to express vigor etc. The word Veerya is used simply for physical capacity of a human being and references are available from Manusmruti, Veda_s, and Bhaagavata Puraanam in the support of this idea. According to Vedic literature and the commentary of Saayan`a there on, Veerya means, the special capacity (Saamarthya) not only necessary for physical and mental activity, but also that which is necessary for worldly capacity to possess different kinds of wealth, like cattle, progeny, wealth, (Pashu, Puthra, Dhana etc) has been meant by it. The S`habdakalpadruma has quoted in support of it. Amarakos`ha, Nayanananda and Ramanatha all these authorities have described the meaning of Veerya as Utsaaha. The ordinary Utsaaha is not known as Veerya the required amount of vitality is produced by Veerya. In the ancient Sanskrit literature the meaning of word Veerya is ascribed to Shukra Dhaatu as well as for male genital organ. In the Ayurvedic literature the Veerya is used for the S`hakti or energy through which drug can act in the body. Intactness of Veerya in different pharmaceutical preparations was described by Naaraayan`adaasa in his Paribhaasha as follows  In Kalka and Kashaaya the Veerya remains intact up to one Yaama (3hours), in Choorn`a for 3 Paksha (45 days), In Ghrita and Modakas along with Gud`a for six months, in Guggulu preparation for 3 months, Siddharasa and Bhasma for 3 years, and medicated oils for a considerable long time, the Veerya respectively remains intact. Veerya- According to Charaka, the power, which performs work or action, is Veerya. He said that there is no action without Veerya. All actions take place only because of Veerya. The term Veerya means power, potency and efficacy. It also conveys the meaning meaningless and valor. Prof. Dvarkanath opines  the term Veerya conveys the idea of energy. The energy of a body is its capacity for doing work and the measure of energy is work. Energy may be potential or kinetic. Described in terms of Veerya, the former (potential energy) is S`heeta and the latter (kinetic energy) is Ushn`a. The chemical energy locked up in the food substances / drugs represents S`heeta Veerya. Substances (food or drug) from which energy is readily released in Paaka karma (Vipaaka) under the influence or the action of Kaayaagni (or bio-chemical reactions) involving oxidation, which in part manifests as heat, are Ushn`a in Veerya. Discussing the number of Veerya_s Charaka has quoted the contemporary views, which enumerate Asht`avidha and Dvividha Veerya concepts and at the same time he did not mention his own opinion. Unlike Charaka, Sus`hruta firmly opines that Veerya, Veerya in general for Rasa, Gun`a & Prabhaava. So this Vaada was named as S`hakti Veerya Vaada or the general Veerya concept or Bahuvidha Veerya Vaada. b) Paribhaashika Veerya Vaada: Sus`hruta has denoted Veerya as the generator of a drug action. Aachaarya Sus`hruta put fourth the Dvividha Veerya Vaada i.e. Ushn`a and S`heeta Veerya_s which represents Agni (heat) and soma (cold) of the universe. He has also quoted contemporary Asht`a Vidha Veerya Vaada which considers 8 gun`a as out of 20 gun`a_s Veerya. But in Vis`hada, Pichchhila, were mentioned in place of Guru and Laghu. The eight Gun`a_s are - Snigdha, Rooksha, Vis`hada, Pichchhila, S`heeta, Ushn`a, Mridu and Teekshn`a. He has also stated the Dvividha Veerya Vaada known as Ushn`a and S`heeta. D`ahlan`a commenting on Sus`hruta`s verses stated Achintya and Chintya Veerya_s. The former also denoted as Prabhaava. Vaagbhat`a followed the Charakian school of thought and also Sushrutas observations. But regarding Asht`a Vidha Veerya Guru-Laghu was mentioned instead of Vis`hada and Pichchhila. Hemaadri has made a reference to the view that Veerya_s are many and observed that though Veerya has been described as two types; it can still be as many as there are actions to be performed. In this view, all actions regardless of Gun`a_s, are due to Veerya and, therefore, there can be as many Veerya_s as there are actions. The other significant clarification offered by Hemaadri, which has a direct bearing on the subject now under study, is that which evokes taste perception is Rasa and all the rest are Gun`a_s. Particular or distinct Vis`hisht`a Rasa  or taste that occurs, as the result of Kaayaagnipaaka is Vipaaka and the resultant Guna at this stage is Veerya. Arun`adatta has stated that Gun`a_s are only Veerya_s but not Rasa_s as the latter cannot withstand the influence of Kaayaagnipaaka and undergoes changes. 2. Karma Veerya Vaada: Bhadanta Naagaarjuna has envisaged the Karma Veerya Vaada by furnishing a definition for Veerya as Karmalakshan`am Veeryam. Gun`a Veerya Vaada was subjected to severe criticism by Aachaarya Naagaarjuna. He has described certain Veerya such as Chhardaneeya Veerya, Anulomana Veerya etc. Nimi has mentioned 15 types of Veerya_s such as Urdhvabhaagahara Veerya, Adhobhaagahara Veerya etc. 3. Dravya Veerya Vaada: Shivadasa Sen+ has observed Veerya is a special power. The uniqueness of Veerya has been stressed by him as he observes  S`hakti is Veerya. It alone is capable of performing powerful actions. These actions do not suffer from any limitations due to non-attachment of Veerya_s to Rasa_s. Veerya is intimately correlated to gun`a_s viz., S`heeta etc. Since Veerya inheres inseparably in Dravya_s, it is considered to be complementary to Rasa_s. Shivadasa Sen propounded a different type of definition of Veerya as follows  It is not the quality of a substance, are two only i.e. Ushn`a and S`heeta. He also quotes the contemporary view of Asht`avidha Veerya Vaada. Vaagbhat`a truly followed Charaka and quoted the contemporary views of Ashtavidha Veerya and Dvividha Veerya Vaada. A critical appraisal of Brihatrayee indicates that Substrata alone accepted the Dvividha Veerya concepts while Charaka simply made a mention about these concepts without quoting his agreement to them. Vaagbhat`a after quoting the concept of Asht`a Veerya_s and Charakas definition of Veerya substantiated Guna Veerya Vaada i.e., Asht`avidha Veerya and Dvividha Veerya_s. Table  I the reasons for considering 8 Gun`a_s as Veerya_s: Charaka defines the term Veerya as the power that performs work. He further observes that all actions take place only because of Veerya and there is no action, which is not due to Veerya. Chakrapaan`i Datta while emphasizing the view that Gun`a_s are only modes of S`hakti observes that the term Veerya is meant for Rasa, Gun`a, Vipaaka or Prabhaava of a Dravya. Dalhan`a also opines Veerya as S`hakti whether it is of two or eight kinds. Shivadasa Sen observes that Veerya is a special power. Aachaarya Yadavji interprets Veerya as active principle of the drug. Prof. P.V.Sharma differing with Yadavji`s concept argues that active principle is also a Dravya and Veerya being a Gun`a cannot be equated with active principle. Prof. C.Dvarakanatha equating Veerya with energy interprets Ushn`a and S`heeta Veerya_s as kinetic and potential energies. Different concepts of Veerya were described in two different texts. Mainly 3 concepts were mentioned namely S`hakti Veerya Vaada Paribhaashika Veerya Vaada consisting of Dvividha and Asht`a Vidha Veerya Vaada Let us consider these concepts one by one with their implications. Gun`a Veerya Vaada: a) S`hakti Veerya Vaada: Charakian system has delineated Veerya as S`hakti and defined it in its own verses as Yena Kurvanti Tat Veeryam. Chakrapaan`i. Chakraapan`i Datta has implied the term fraction of a substance itself, capable of performing a special action, and also derived from the very important part of the Paanchabhautika structure of the Dravya itself. He has also mentioned Kritrima and Sahaja Veerya_s. Aachaarya Yadavji supporting the concept of the active principle as Veerya indirectly prefers Dravya Veerya Vaada. To sum up and summarize, the fundamental principle of drug action Veerya has been dealt in different aspects such as S`hakti, Utkrisht`agun`a_s and Karma_s. Table II  Classification of Veerya_s 5. Paancha Bhautikatva of Veerya Aahaara (Diet) and Aushadha (medicine) substances contain Panchamahaabhoota_s. Aachaarya_s have enumerated the various Paanchabhautic combinations for the formation of the principles of a drug action. Sus`hruta mentioned about the composition of Panchabhoota_s of different Veerya as follows: 1. Teekshn`a and Ushn`a  - Agnibhoota 2. Guru and S`heeta - Jala Bhoota 3. Snigdha  - Jala Bhoota 4. Mridu - Jala and Akasa Bhootas 5. Rooksha - Vayu Bhoota 6. Laghu - Agni, Aakaas`ha and Vaayu Bhoota_s Functions of Veerya Table III  Various effects and functions of eight Veerya_s The criteria of identification or determination of the principles of drug action namely Rasa, Vipaaka and Veerya are furnished by Agnives`ha. Rasa (taste) of the Dravya_s (Drug/diet) can be ascertained immediately after their contact with the tongue (Nipaata), their Vipaaka by the final action (Nisht`a Karma) and Veerya during their association with the body (Adhivaasa) or immediately after their contact with the body (Nipaata). Rasa or taste is known by direct perception and Vipaaka can only be inferred from its action on Dosha-Dhatu-Mala-Agni and Srotas. As regards Veerya it may sometimes be inferred from its action, e.g. S`heeta Veerya of Saindhava Lavan`a or Ushn`a Veerya of Anupamaamsa (meat of marshy animals) can be inferred from their action on the body. In certain Dravya_s the Veerya) potency) can also be known by direct perception e.g. knowledge of the Teekshn`a Veerya of Raajika is based on olfactory perception. Pichchila (slimness), Vis`hada (non-slimness), Snigdha (unctuousness) and Rooksha (unctuousness) can be known by direct visual perception. Teekshn`a Veerya of Maricha can be determined immediately after its contact with the tongue (Nipaata). They can also be ascertained while it is in the process of digestion and metabolism (Adhivaasa). Chakrapaan`i interprets Adhivaasa as S`hareeranivaasa and spectrum of action of Veerya lies between Nipaata (Rasa) and Karman isht`a (Vipaaka). Substrata  quotes the following criteria for identification of different Veerya_s. Mridu, S`heeta -  Sparshagraahya Pichchila, Vis`hada -  Chakshu + Sparsha Graahya Snigdha, Rooksha, Teekshn`a -  Mukhaduhkhotpaadana Determination of Veerya / Gun`a by Nisht`a Karma, Nipaata & Adhivaasa While discussing the Pharmaco-dynamics of drugs it is clearly mentioned by Charaka that the factor responsible for the manifestation of action / effect is known as Veerya (Ena Kurvanti Tat Veeryam). Sus`hruta also expresses the same concept mentioning that the principle by which drug acts is Veerya (Su.41). Drugs act by virtue of their own nature (Dravya Prabhaava) or by virtue of qualities (Guna Prabhaava) or both. Either Dravya Prabhaava or Guna Prabhaava responsible for drug action can be called as Veerya. The term Gun`a includes Rasa-Gun`a  Veerya  Vipaaka and Prabhaava. Basing on this statement of Charaka, one can classify the concept of Veerya as Dravya Veerya Vaada and Gun`a Veerya Vaada. Dravya Prabhaava means the nature of Dravya but it should not be interpreted as Prabhaava, which is included under Pancha Rasaadigun`a_s i.e. Rasa - Gun`a  Veerya  Vipaaka and Prabhaava. A careful and critical appraisal of the actions attributed to Rasa and Vipaaka indicates that all the their actions are explained in terms of their Gun`a_s. So it may be interpreted that any action is preferred by the most potent Gun`a (Uttkrusht`ha Sampanna Gun`a), which otherwise renamed as Veerya. Hence the determination of Gun`a is done by Nipaata   contact at the tongue level (the term Rasa is employed For Gun`a) or contact with the body Nisht`akarma - Final action (3the terms Vipaaka is given) Adhivaasa  - Reside in the body (the term Veerya is given) The ingested drug starts its action immediately (initial  action of Gun`a / Veerya) and commences its journey to reach Adhisht`haana (site of action), which is the seat of the final action (Vipaaka). The different phases, which contribute to the final, action takes place between Nipaata and Nisht`apaaka stage. Transforming Gun`a_s (Veerya) of the Dravya, which are in transit (Gun`a / Veerya) also carry out certain actions before their final synthesis to perform Nisht`a Karma. According to Hemaadri the principle that evokes taste perception is Rasa and all the rest are Gun`a_s; Vis`hisht`a Rasa (particular or distinct taste), which occurs as the result of Kaayaagnipaaka, is Vipaaka. The Gun`a, which generates at the end of Paaka is Veerya. It can be interpreted in a different way i.e. Rasanagraahya Gun`a is Rasa, Vis`hisht`a Gun`a transformed during Kaayaagnipaaka is Vipaaka and the finally synthesized Guna at the end of the Vipaaka, is Veerya. Based on this it can be concluded that the Gun`a_s / Veerya of a Dravya can be ascertained by Nipaata, Adhivaasa and Nisht`a Karma. To sum up the primary physical qualities such as Guru, Laghu, Ushn`a, S`heeta etc. are co inherent in the Bhoota_s i.e. Pruthvi, Aapa, Tejas, Vaayu and Aakaas`ha on which the constitution of Rasa_s depend. In other words, the characteristic taste (Rasa) of substances is correlated to the Gun`a_s (primary physical qualities) of the Bhoota_s, which collocate in their formation. The criterion for the assessment of Rasa viz. Nipaata should be considered as the index of Gun`a / quality of the drug. The primary physical qualities of the substances are subjected to Physico-chemical reactions or Paaka_s for further synthesis and further potentiation. The potentiated / charged Gun`a_s conferred with Veerya status exercise (Nisht`a Karma) their final action to produce therapeutic effect (Phalam). Barring Rasa, the remaining principles of drug action are assessed by inference. Incase of substances having Avyakta Rasa (unknown taste) the interrelated principles of drug action can be assessed by Anumaanapramaan`a (inference) only. Hence the objective assessment of Rasapanchaka is not absolutely possible but by precise evaluation of the pharmacological action (Karma), the principles of drug action can be inferred in a most rational way. Veerya Nirdhaaran`a Saamaanya Siddhaanta & Apavaada (General Rules with exceptions about Veerya) The general rule is that, a substance that is, Madhura in Rasa (sweet in taste) and Madhura in Vipaaka is S`heeta in Veerya. The substance, which is Amla in Rasa and Vipaaka is Ushna in Veerya. Similarly that which is Kat`u in Rasa and Vipaaka is Ushn`a in Veerya. In this category usually by assessing Rasa of a Dravya one can conclude the Veerya of that particular Dravya. It is also observed that in exceptional cases Veerya may not be in accordance with Rasa. In the following tables the general rule and the exception to the general concept with examples are furnished. Table IV Saamaanya Siddhaanta of Veerya Table V  Charaka quoted following exceptions to Saamanya Siddhanta From the above tables it is clear that the Dravya_s, which follow the general rule, are identified as Samaanapratyayaarabdha and the substances, which differ from the rule, are categorized as Vichitrapratyayaarbdha Dravya_s. Reasons to consider Veerya as the important factor among the principles of Drug action (Veerya Praadhaanya Hetu: Among the Rasapanchaka, Veerya is considered as the most important factor in the process of drug action. Reasons substantiating the importance of Veerya furnished by Sus`hruta are given below. Aushadhakarma Kaaraka: or actions of drugs brought about by their potency. The actions namely S`hodhana, S`hamana, Graahi, Agnideepana, Peed`ana, Lekhana, Brimhan`a, Rasaayana, Vaajeekaran`a, S`hvayathukara, Vilayana, Dahana, Dhaaran`a, Praan`aghna, Vishapras`hamana etc are produced by Veerya only. Veerya is of two type i.e. Ushn`a and S`heeta in accordance with the nature of the universe which is formed of Agni (heat) and Soma (cold). Some consider Veerya to be of eight types i.e. S`heeta-Ushn`a, Snigdha-Rooksha, Vis`hada-Pichchhila and Mridu-Teekshn`a. Veerya suppresses the action of Rasa and performs its own function owing to its overpowering property. Examples are: If Vaata alleviating Rasa_s (Madhura-Amla-Lavan`a) possess Rooksha-Laghu-S`heeta Gun`a_s as they do not pacify Vaata. If Pitta alleviating Rasa_s (Kashaaya-Tikta-Madhura) possess Teeksn`a-Ushn`a  Laghu Gun`a_s, they do not pacify Pitta. If the Kapha  alleviating Rasa_s (Kat`u-Tikta-Kashaaya) possesses Snigdha-Guru-S`heeta Gun`a_s they are not capable of pacifying Kapha. Hence it can be concluded that Veerya is the most important principle among the principles of drug action. Aagama: Aachaarya_s (Aapta_s) consider Veerya as the most superior principle of drug action (Rasa Vaishesha) Research on Veerya: Action of Ushn`a & S`heeta Veerya drugs on skeletal muscle A total 24 drugs of 12 each belonging to Ushn`a and S`heeta Veerya_s respectively have been selected at random. Their aqueous extracts (10% water infusion) were tested for their activity against contractions of frog skeletal muscle (Frog Rectus Abdominis) by using Burn model (1954) Two similar dose response curves with Acetylecholine were taken (1r, 2r doses) before and after injecting 1 ml 10% solution of the trial drug However, statistical analysis showed insignificant inhibition of both the Veerya_s. Therefore the skeletal muscle experiment does not reveal any specificity about the nature of Ushn`a and S`heeta Veerya drugs (Nishteswar K. et.al) 2. Effect of Ushn`a & S`heeta Veerya drugs on frog heart muscle The aqueous extracts if 16 Ushn`a and 16 S`heeta Veerya drugs were screened on 32 healthy frog hearts. Conventional method for this experiment was followed as suggested by Burn (1952). The effect of Ushn`a and S`heeta Veerya drugs in different doses (0.2 ml and 0.4 ml) was assessed on the basis of heart rate (Chronotropic activity) and amplitude (Inotropic) activity of isolated frog heart during and after perfusion). S`heeta Veerya group has shown significant decrease of amplitude (P<0.05) at the dose of 0.4 ml while Ushna Veerya drugs have significant depressant action at 0.2 ml and 0.4 ml doses (P<0.01) It is evident that more depressant effect on amplitude was exercised by Ushn`a Veerya group in comparison, with S`heeta Veerya group. Both S`heeta and Ushn`a Veerya, drugs have shown insignificant decrease of heart rate. Hence the action of Ushn`a and S`heeta Veerya drugs cannot be associated with positive and negative Chronotropic and Ionotropic effect since both the groups have not shown a specific action on frog heart rate and amplitude (Nishteswar K.et.al.) Two S`heeta Veerya drugs namely Yasht`imadhu and S`hataavaree, and two Ushn`a Veerya drugs namely Chitraka and Jaatiphala have been taken for this study. In healthy volunteers initially B.M.R. was recorded with Mc. Kission Metaboler. Then the drug was administrated three times for only one day (Chitraka and Jatiphala 2 gm each and Yashtimadhu and Shatavari 5 gm each) A significant increase (P<0.05) has been observed with Yasht`i, while increase in B.M.R with S`hataavaree is not very significant. The action of Ushn`a Veerya drugs is quite opposite i.e. they bring about a decrease in B.M.R. after administration. Both Chitraka and Jaatiphala have shown a very significant action. (P<0.05) Therefore S`heeta and Ushn`a Veerya_s, which represents the Saumyatva and Agneyatva of a drug or food, may be responsible for synthesizing or metabolizing the Dhaatu_s due to their Santarpan`a or Apatarpan`a actions (Nishteswar K. et. Al.) 4. Study of Veerya Vis--Vis pH value of Drugs Total 25 Ushn`a and 25 S`heeta Veerya drugs have been screened for pH value in cold water and hot water with pH water. 10gms of each drug was soaked in 100 ml of distilled water and kept for one hour. After one hour the pH of the sample was tested. Then the sample was kept on water bath for 30 minutes and again pH was recorded. In the end all the screened drugs have shown acidic reaction. It is evident from the present study that Ushna and S`heeta Veerya drugs do not exhibit specific difference in pH values (Nishtheshvar K and Dhayani S.C) The above experiments carried out for evaluating Veerya have not communicated the specific nature of Veerya. invitro studies designed with frogs heart and skeletal muscle can be categorized as Nipaata study of Veerya, which also did not give any lead. Effects of Veerya on B.M.R in human volunteers, which fall under Adhivaasa category, have shown significant response. In view of the Agni and Soma concepts, which are interpreted as acidic and alkaline nature of substance, pH value was assessed and this experiment also failed to show any specificity regarding Veerya. Animal studies provide analogies and serve as useful models only to evaluate different actions (Karma) but not the principles of drug action. It is rightly said that a cat or a rat cannot act as an ideal model for man. Clinical pharmacology (Dravyagun`a) which involves the study of various aspects of drug action and metabolism in humans, both in health and in disease and which is also a part of medicine (Kaayachikitsaa) should be preferred for evaluating Ayurvedic principles of drug action. While evaluating these principles one should follow unbiased and uncompromising adherence to the S`haastrika descriptions. Dr. Nishtheshvar K. Asst.

Nanal Many food items whose properties have not been described in the ancient Ayurvedic texts are now an integral part of our daily lives. The Ayurvedic physician in the course of his career makes certain decisions about the properties of these substances and decides whether that substance comes under the heading of Pathya or Apathya for a particular patient. May new food items have become available in the course of time. However the basic composition of the Mahaabhoota present in the substances remains constant. According to this composition the physician can arrive at certain logical conclusions as to the effect of that substance on the human body. Also he verifies his conclusions by using the substance in his practice and observing its actions, to validate this hypothesis or otherwise. Considering these conclusions briefly: Sanskaara Any process, which changes the natural properties of a substance and gives rise to a new set of properties, is known as Sanskaara or Gun`aantaraadhaana. Each Dravya performs certain functions according to the distinct Gun`a present in it. When these Gun`a change due to Sanskaara, after processing the Dravya exhibits a new set of properties which may be in accordance with its original set or it may exhibit a set of new properties which are diagonally opposite to the original due to which the Dravya performs actions which are in accordance with its original nature or which totally defy its original nature. These changes therefore have to be considered by the physician before he decides to use the substance. The various ways in which this change in Gun`a or Gun`aantaraadhaana can take place; have been described by Ayurveda e.g. these can be effected by subjecting the substance to the action of Agni, Jala, Kaala, S`huddhi, storage in various vessels i.e. Bhaajana etc. The Sanskaara of Agni on rice grains leads to the formation of Laajaa which is Laghu , Rooksa, Sookshma and which absorb the Drava in the body. Tan`d`ulodaka, which involves Jala Sanskaara, is S`heeta, performing the Kaarya of Staambhana, appeasing Trishn`aa, and creating Aalhaada. Due to Toya Agni Sanskaara involving Jala and Agni on rice grains, various food items like Man`d`a, Peyaa, Vilepee and cooked rice are prepared. By adjusting the amount of Jala and Agni different items can be prepared. Kaala Sanskaara new rice is Guru, i.e. heavy to digest, it increases the Drava Gun`a and urine quantity in the body and it initiates the activity of Kapha and Pitta. However the rice which is stored for one year old is Laghu or easy to digest and has Rooksha or dry properties. Rice which is sowed in the rainy season and which reaches and of its growth by the S`harada Ritu is Amla Vipaakee (i.e. it displays the functions of Amla Rasa after digestion) which is why it is Avrishya or destroys the S`hukra Dhaatu in the body. On the other hand rice which is sown in the cold season (Hemanta and S`his`hira) and which is ready by the Grishma Ritu (summer) is Vrishya or it increases the amount of S`hukra Dhaatu in the body because it is Madhura Vipaakee. Bhaajana Sanskaara Rice stored in an earthen vessel is more Rooksha and Laghu and rice stored in metal containers retains its Snigdha Gun`a. Keeping this process of Sanskaara in mind we will consider the difference between Vanaspatee Ghee and Ghrita or Pure Ghee. All kinds of oils are obtained from their respective oilseeds by cold press extraction process. The common properties of oil are. the extracted oil is comparable to its parent see; in addition to these it has Teekshn`ataa (Intensity, sharpness), Vyavaayi (it has c capacity to spread all over the internal environment without the help of Jaat`haraagni and then be converted by the Dhaatvaagni, Sookshmatva (subtleness which makes it capable of reaching the smallest body constituents), Ushn`ataa (heat which makes it effective on Agni), along with these it also exhibits a precipitating action on skin diseases and is harmful to the eyes and eyesight as well. it is not conducive to formation of Kapha inspite of being Snigdha (unctuous). Therefore, in general, each oil will have the Gun`a of the oilseed it has been extracted from as well as certain other Gun`a, due to the Sanskaara it is subjected to. The oil will be Kat`u Vipaaka i.e. it displays the properties of Kat`u Rasa after the process of digestion. When Ghrita is being prepared from milk it passes through various stages. Fresh milk Dhaaroshn`a after it has been boiled gently on mild heat; due to this mild heat the Sneha in the milk separates from the Drava part and this forms a layer of cream (Santaanikaa) on the surface. After this by addition of buttermilk or curds the milk is set to form curds. The curds is then put through a process of Manthana or churning, and due to the opposite forces while churning, Takra is formed, Takra consists of Amla Rasa, Kashaaya Anurasa and Rooksha Gun`a. Also this process of churning inevitably leads to the formations of Navneeta or butter. Navaneeta is Asthaayi (temporary) and Mridu and Snigdha. Finally due to the action of Agni on this Navaneeta, Ghrita which is Madhura Rasaatmaka, Snigdha Gun`aatmaka is formed. The water present in Navaneeta must completely evaporate for Ghrita to be formed. Also some amount of cream settles down at the bottom and forms a black residue. Therefore Ghrita which is devoid of any unnecessary Paarthiva part, and which consists only of Sneha is formed Therefore the diagonally opposite properties and nature of Taila and Ghrita become clear in the above table, Method of preparation of Vanaspatee Ghee: The particular oil is heated until it reaches its boiling point and when it starts boiling, hydrogen gas, which has been stored under a specific amount of pressure, is mixed with it. Due to this process of mixing hydrogen under pressure with boiling hot oil (i.e. due to Sanyoga Sanskaara) Saandra (dense), Mritsna (Granular), Snigdha Vanaspatee Ghee, which is similar in appearance to Ghrita, is formed. The properties of the constituents of Vanaspatee Ghee: The boiling oil when interacts with the hydrogen under pressure a new entity called hydrogenated vegetable oil is formed. The amount of heat required for its formation cannot be provided by the human Agni. The comparatively more intense Jaat`haraagni can just melt it in the alimentary canal / Kosht`ha but the same molten hydrogenated vegetable oil reaches the Dhaatu the infinitesimal fraction of the Jaat`haaraagni situated in the smallest functional body unit is incapable of breaking it down and metabolize it. Here the dense, slow, heavy, granular nature of the hydrogenated vegetable oil causes occlusion of the micro channels thereby hindering the normal function of the Dhaatu. Due to the above mentioned processes Vanaspatee Ghee acquires properties which are not originally present in the specific oil. S`hveta Varn`a, Saandra Gun`a, the property of melting on heating and solidifying, cooling, Vidaahee Gun`a, and its capacity to give rise to Sroto-rodha and create Agni-Maandya these are the Gun`a acquired by Taila when it undergoes various Sanskaara to form Vanaspatee Ghee. Therefore while attempting to explain Vanaspatee Ghee from an Ayurvedic view-point, it is possible to ascertain its properties despite the fact that it has not been described by the Ayurvedic texts, by applying the basic rules of Dravya Gun`a and Dosha Dhaatu and Mala Siddhaanta. Conditions in which Vanaspatee Ghee should not be used: Conditions suitable for use of Vanaspatee Ghee: Due to its Shlakshn`a, Saandra, Mritsna, Snigdha Gun`a, Vanaspatee Ghee proves useful as a Malahara / ointment in conditions like Paadadaaeei, Vipaadikaa etc. Therefore on studying the properties of Vanaspatee Ghee, we find it does not prove beneficial to the human body, and it must be avoided as far as possible.

Vipaaka is one of the properties of Dravya. The drug action seen on the body is a resultant effect of any of Rasa, Gun`a, Veerya, Vipaaka and Prabhaava. Vipaaka is of three types as Madhura, Amla and Kat`u. Though their actions are similar to the respective Rasa, they are different from the respective Rasa as they become functional after the processing of Agni on Dravya. Definition: A.H.Su.9/20 This is the definition of Vipaaka. After coming in contact with Jaatharaagni, transformation occurs in the constitutional configuration of Mahaabhoota of Rasas and the resultant constitutional change is called as Vipaaka. 1 In the process of digestion all the Rasas undergo three Avasthaapaakas i.e. Madhura, Amla and Kat`u simultaneously and the resultant change that dominates after the complete process is called as Vipaaka. Vipaaka is of three types 1. Madhura, 2.Amla, 3.Kat`u  Rasa And Vipaaka Relation:  This is a general rule for Vipaaka since there are exceptions like Aamalakee is Amla Dravya and still has Madhura Vipaaka; Kulattha has Kashaaya Rasa and Amla Vipaaka etc. Opinions about Vipaaka: 1. Pancha Bhautika Vipaaka- Su.Su.46/526 Here Aahaara is told as Panchadhaa Vipakva and hence Vipaaka is considered as of five types namely Paancha Bhautika. 2 2. Dvividha Vipaaka- The three Vipaakas told earlier are further categorized into Laghu and Guru based on Bhautika domination. Madhura Vipaaka has Aapa and Prithvi Mahaabhoota dominating which are Guru in nature hence it is Guru Vipaaka. Kat`u Vipaaka has domination of Agni and Vaayu Mahaabhoota which are Laghu in nature hence it is Laghu Vipaaka. Amla Vipaaka has domination of Prithvi and Agni Mahaabhoota but its effects are similar to Laghu hence it is Laghu Vipaaka. Difference between Rasa and Vipaaka : Though the resultant change is named after Madhura,Amla and Kat`u Rasas, there is basic difference in them.Rasas are perceivable by Rasanendriya but Vipaaka is not perceivable by sense organs directly.But the effects it shows on the body are similar to those of Madhura, Amla, Kat`u Rasa.Therefore it is called as Rasaihi tulyaphalah and not merely Rasaihi Tulya. 3 Effects of Vipaaka on Body 4 : C.Su.26/61-62 Here S`hukra is representative of all the Dhaatu. S`hukrala indicates increase in all the Dhaatu. S`hukranaas `hana indicates declining in quality of S` hukra and incapability to increase its quantity. Similar is in the case of S`hukrhaa, where quantity also affects. Here are some examples of Vipaaka: Madhura Vipaaka- Gokshura has Madhura Rasa and Madhura Vipaaka and it increases urine, pacifies vitiated Vaata Dosha and increase Dhaatu. Godhuma has Madhura Rasa with Madhura Vipaaka and it increases Kapha and all the Dhaatu as well as Mala. Exception - Yava i.e. Barley which is Madhura Rasa Dravya has Kat`u Vipaaka and hence doesnt pacify Vaata but increases it. Amla Vipaaka- Chaangeree is Amla Rasa Dravya having Amla Vipaaka hence increases Pitta Dosha and Mala. Exception- Aamalakee has Amla Rasa as Pradhaana Rasa but its Vipaaka is Madhura hence instead of increasing Pitta it pacifies vitiated Pitta. Kat`u Vipaaka- Maricha has Kat`u Rasa and Kat`u Vipaaka due to which it increases Pitta; it also reduces Mala and Dhaatu. Exception- Pork has Kat`u Rasa and still it has Madhura Vipaaka hence it doesnt vitiates but pacifies it. 5 References: Ashtanga Hrudaya by Vagbhatacharya, Pub.

That leads to formation of Aama, vitiation of Dosha and manifestation of symptoms, collectively called as Aamadosha. Definition of Aama: Ushman`o Alpa Balatvena Dhaatum Aadyam Apaachitam | Dusht`am Aamaas`hayagatam Rasam Aamam Prachakshate || A. H. Su. 13/25 Aama is formed due to decreased digestive capacity. In the process of digestion, Rasa Dhaatu remains undigested and gets vitiated. This vitiated Rasa remains in the Aamaas`haya causing various symptoms and diseases. This is called as Aama Dosha. Causes of Aamadosha: Diet consumed in large amount than the hunger, it is called Atimaatraas`hana, which is cause of aggravation of all the three Dosha. When a person consumes food in a large amount, and drinks water after consumption, due to the irritation caused by the excess food all the three Dosha get aggravated. Not only excess food quantity is responsible for Aama Dosha but the food having attributes like Guru, Rooksha, S`heeta etc. also causes Aama Dosha. Though the food is taken in proper amount, factors like Chintaa etc. are also responsible for Aama Dosha If all the Dosha are vitiated and they get accumulated, then intermingle to produce Aama as poison is formed from the Kodrava. Sampraapti of Aamadosha: Agni Dusht`ee is basic cause of Aamadosha. Due to hampered digestive capacity, though light food is consumed it is not digested then it resembles to S`hukta (fermented substance) and turns to Anna Visha. These Dosha get mixed with the undigested food. They remain there without any movement (Alasaka) or suddenly they get purged out either through the mouth or through the anus (Visoochikaa). Thus, they create different types of Vyaadhi. Anna Visha (food turned into poison) gets associated with Pitta, then it manifests with Daaha, Trishn`aa, Mukhaamaya (diseases of oral cavity), Amlapitta and other diseases due to Pitta. If it gets associated with Kapha, then it manifests in Yakshmaa, Peenasa, Meha and other Kapha predominant diseases.  General Properties of Aama: Clinical presentation of Aamadosha When the diseases are either caused by Saama Dosha, Saama Dooshya / Dhaatu or Saama Mala or have stage of Aama association, are called as Saama.

N. 6 Introduction: Literally, Agnimaandya refers to the state of lowered digestive capacity. Agni: Concept Agni is the digestive capacity. It is one of the Panchamahaabhoota, whose functions are similar to the Agni Mahaabhoota in the Universe. It is the factor responsible for any change in Bhaava Padaartha (matter). Pachana (digestion) is the most important activity carried out by the Agni. Whenever any fruit ripens, the ripening is carried out by the Agni. It is Agni only, which turns the qualities of food into the qualities of Dhaatu in the human body. Gurutva or Sthira attribute of Godhooma (wheat) is placed into the human body after the transformation of Godhooma by Agni. Therefore to maintain balance of Dhaatu functioning of Agni should be proper. If this transformation of food attributes into the bodily attributes hampers or loses its balance, then it causes imbalance in the Dhaatu. This is an unwanted effect. This is called a case of hampered or vitiation of Agni (digestion capacity). Agni, which is responsible for transformation of food, is called Jaat`haraagni as it dwells in the Jat`hara. So whenever the term Agni is used it indicates Jaat`haraagni and not Dhaatvagni (Agni at the level of Dhaatu). Agni: Types This Agni according to its capacity to digest is divided into four types: Manda (low digestive capacity)  due to the dominanace of Kapha Dosha Teekshn`a (higher digestive capacity)  Due to the dominance of Pitta Dosha Vishama (irregular digestive capacity)  Due to the dominance of Vaata Dosha Sama (balanced digestive capacity)  Sama state of all the three Dosha. Out of these 4 types of Agni, Sama is the normal state and other states are abnormal (Vikrita) as they cause imbalance in Dhaatu. Only Sama Agni is the cause of Dhaatu Saamya (Balance in the all seven Dhaatu) Vishama Agni causes Vaataja diseases. Teekshn`a Agni causes Pittaja diseases. Manda Agni is responsible for Kaphaja diseases. 1. Sama Agni - When food is taken in Sama Maatraa (perfect amount of food to fulfill hunger, not more or less) and is digested easily and without causing any trouble, this digestive capacity is called Sama Agni. According to Charaka, Sama Agni gets vitiated due to an improper conduct regarding food and it remains in balance in the absence of improper conduct regarding food. According to Asht`aanga Sangraha, when food is digested in four Yaama (12 hours), Agni is said to be Sama Agni. 2. Manda Agni Though food in fewer amounts, is not digested easily. It takes more time to digest. This digestive capacity is called Manda Agni. Manda Agni can not tolerate any improper conduct regarding food. It causes Aadhmaana, Aasya S`hosha, Aat`opa, Aantra Koojana. 3. Vishama Agni When food in usual amount sometimes digested and sometimes not; this status of digestion is called as Vishama Agni. According to Charaka Vishama Agni is exactly opposite of the Sama Agni. Vishama Agni causes imbalance in the Dhaatu. When the consumed food exceeds hunger, Vishama Agni may digest it fast whereas food taken in the proper amount as per the hunger, it may digest it very slowly and may take a longer time. 4. Teekshn`a Agni - When food is taken in more amount than the hunger, then also the food may get digested easily. This digestive capacity is called Teekshn`a Agni. Teekshn`a Agni, if not supplied with adequate food, causes depletion of Dhaatu. Teekshn`a Agni can tolerate any improper conduct regarding food. Atyanta Teekshn`a Agni (hyper digestion capacity) is a disease called Bhasmaka. Teekshn`a Agni digests food, which is taken in a larger amount than the hunger. Amongst all these Agni, Sama Agni is responsible for health hence should be maintained.

Madhukos`ha People who consume food without considering their own capacity to eat and eat excessively, suffer from the disease Ajeern`a, which is the root cause of all the diseases. This indigestion may be due to Vaata, Pitta or Kapha. Actually, due to Ajeern`a all the three Dosha get aggravated, but the types of Ajeern`a are named after the more dominant individual Dosha. Causes of Ajeern`a: Over consumption of food is obvious cause. Other causes include heavy to digest food or large quantity also frequent munching. Even though light food is consumed at proper time, it might not digested because of psychological disturbances like Eershyaa, Bhaya, Krodha, Parikshata, Lobha, S`hoka, Dainya, Dvesha etc. Hence it is necessary to have Prasanna Chitta (fresh and cheerful mind) for digestion of food. Sampraapti: Due to Abhojana, Ajeern`a Bhojana etc. Agni gets vitiated. (i.e. digestive capacity gets hampered). Therefore, though it is light (Laghu) to digest it can not digest food. It gets S`hukta (fermented) and ultimately turns into poison.

Though there is Udgaara S`huddhi there is no willingness to have food. Since there are remnants of Aaahaara Rasa, which are still to be digested, this condition is called Rasas`heshaajeern`a. Dinapaaki Ajeern`a (Nirdosha Ajeern`a) When food gets digested the next day and does not get digested on the same day, it is called Dinapaaki Ajeern`a.

It is characterized by symptoms such as indigestion, abdominal distension, and constipation.

U. 56.3 After having food in excess quantity, there is no space in the Aamaas`haya for Dosha to act upon the food. Therefore they become idle and static. There is no movement of the food in the Aamaas`haya to digest the food. Hence as Dosha and food become idle and irritated (Dosha Sthiratva and Dosha Kshobha) in the Aamaas`haya, the condition is called Alasaka. According to Charaka, this is an Aamapradoshaja Vikaara. Sampraapti A weakened person having less digestive capacity (Agni), having aggravated Kapha, who indulges in suppression of natural urges of Vaata, Mootra and Pureesha, and who consumes food having attributes like Sthira, Guru, Bahu, Rooksha, S`heeta, S`hushka suffers from Alasaka. In the above situation, consumed food gets mixed with the Vaata and Kapha. The Srotas is Vibaddha (obstructed) and the Mala are adherent (Leena) due to which these Dosha can not be purged out through mouth. So there is a manifestation of symptoms of Aama without manifestation of Chhardi, Ateesaara. This is called Alasaka. According to Vaagbhat`a all the three Dosha get aggravated simultaneously in the Aamaas`haya. These Dosha and Aama vitiate food causing Visht`mbha (endurance of food and Dosha). Alasaka manifest in the Kukshi Aanaaha (stability or idleness in the flanks), Moha (Prataamyate), Parikoojana (Aartanaada) (an inarticulate or oppressed sound). Dosha travel in the upward direction as the downward channel is obstructed due to the idle Dosha. There is Vaata Nirodha and Varcha Nirodha (constipation), Trishn`aa (thirst), Udgaara (belching).

When there is severe increase of Dosha in Alasaka, the Aama obstructs all the channels moving all over the body. It causes Stambha (stiffness) of the body like a pillar. This is called Dan`d``lasaka.

Our Aachaaryaas had this vision; hence they explained the concept of understanding the new diseases (Anukta Vyaadhi). Anukta Vyaadhi are the diseases which are neither elaborated or nor described in classical texts or lexicons of Aayurveda. To understand and appreciate the concept of Anukta Vyaadhi due consideration to the basic concepts of Ayurveda is a must i.e. Dosha  Dhaatu  Mala Vidnyaana, Concept of Rasa, Gun`a, Veerya, Vipaaka and Karma etc. for easy and better understanding. Though these are not interpreted by their names, the cluster of signs and symptoms and the underlying pathology can be understood by the basic principles: which not only help in understanding the pathogenesis but also give us a direction to think in terms of treatment for the same. As to what may be the probable reasons for Anuktatva, the reasons may be many but can be summed up as:- The system of teaching In adequate material and time constraints for documentation Innumerable Hetu and Lakshan`a Constant out break of epidemics New causative factors Continuous change in diet and life style There arises a question as to how to diagnose these Vyaadhi, when they have not been explained or elaborated in our texts. But our Aachaaryaas have commented that a Vaidya need not be ashamed in such a condition where he / she cannot name a disease; in fact it is not at all necessary to know the exact nomenclature as that is not always possible. But it does not mean that one cannot diagnose such a condition. It can be diagnosed by the following methodology i.e. Based on the causative factors Based on the group of Lakshan`a Based on the basic concepts of Vikriti Vidnyaana i.e. The logic behind this is that the pathogenesis should involve the basic Sampraapti factors like Dosha, Dhaatu Agni, Srotas; without the involvement of these the disease cannot get manifested and hence the through knowledge of these basic factors helps us to understand the pathology involved and accordingly the treatment can be planned. The above table in relation to basic Principles can be illustrated with an example of a contemporary disease i.e., Carpel Tunnel Syndrome: After analyzing the causative factors involved in the pathogenesis, one can treat such a condition based on the basic treatment principles i.e. Nidaana Parivarjana( Avoiding the causative factors) Reverse Pathogeneses:- The factors involved in the pathogeneses (Sampraapti Ghat`aka\u00e0 Dosha, Dhaatu, Mala, Agni, Aama, Udbhava Sthaana, Vyakti Sthaana, Srotas, Sroto Dusht`i Prakaara) Viruddha Gun`a Chikitsaa Thus not knowing the nomenclature of the disease is not of utmost importance but understanding the pathogeneses and treating the same brings in a self satisfaction to the Vaidya and at the same time the patient shows a sense of gratitude and faith.

Types: Vaataja Pittaja Kaphaja Saannipaatika Sampraapti: Following type of people are more prone to Apasmaara. Whose mind is afflicted by Rajas and Tamas (Rajastamobhyaam Upahata Chetas), When the Dosha are highly aggravated (Samudbhraanta) and their equilibrium is disturbed (Vishama), When an individual takes unclean food having unwholesome ingredients possessing mutually contradictory properties or touched by the unclean people who are infected with contagious diseases, People not obeying the dietetic rules like Asht`au Aahaara Vidhi Vis`hesha Aayatana, Having unhealthy regimens and behavior and suffer from excessive debility. With these conditions, aggravated Dosha penetrate at the site of the Great Soul (Antaraatmaa i. e. Hridaya and the resting place of senses, Indriya Aayatana), in a person whose mind is afflicted by Rajas and Tamas .While staying there, these Dosha_s, get aggravated by desire (Kaama), anger (Krodha), fear (Bhaya), greed (Lobha), perplexity (Moha), joy (Harsha), sorrow (S`hoka), anxiety (Chintaa), agitation (Udvega) and all of a sudden spread throughout the heart and the sense organs, which lead to the loss of memory (Apasmarati). This is a paroxysm of Apasmaara. Lakshan`a: When the Dosha located in the Dhamanee, afflict the heart and cause disturbances in the functions the affected person is afflicted with agitation (Vyathaa), wandering mind (Bhraanta Chetas) etc. That person visualizes non existent forms, Falls down and gets tremors. His eyes, tongue, eyebrows become distorted. Saliva comes out of his mouth. His hands and legs become convulsed. When the paroxysm is over, he regains consciousness as if he is getting up from sleep. Description of Doshaja Types: The aggravated Dosha_s cause paroxysms in fifteen days, twelve days or in a month. The paroxysm may however take place even at shorter intervals. Dosha are aggravated due to faulty and excessive use of sense objects and actions, incompatible, dirty food and also due to indulgence in lust, fear, agitation, anger, grief etc. Mind of the People who are in the habit of suppressing urges, who take unwholesome and dirty food, are overpowered by Rajas and Tamas and perform coitus with menstruating woman get affected and they suffer from Apasmaara. In Apasmaara, Sattva gets suppressed by Rajas and Tamas. Here Sattva refers to an attribute of Mind. Though Sattva refers to the mind it is also denoted by different words. (Ch. Chi. 10/5) There it has been said that Manas gets afflicted by Chintaa etc. In a person whose mind is destructed due to anxiety (Chintaa), sorrow (S`hoka), and fear (Bhaya) and hence intellect and Sattva flow out, Doshaa_s aggravated like Unmaada spread in Hridaya and channel affecting psychological traits (Sandnyaavaha Srotas). In this condition, a person behaves loathsome and gropes in the dark. There is a frothy vomiting, he behaves convulsively by moving hands and feet, has hallucinations, falls down on, his tongue, eyes, eyebrows get distorted. When the force of the Doshaa_s gets reduced he gets up as if he was asleep. This paroxysm may happen after a period. At times, Doshaja Apasmaara is associated with Aagantu factors (Exogenous Causes). Apasmaara due to Aagantu causes has symptoms due to the vitiation of the Dosha_s, which manifest themselves in addition to those caused by Aagantu Hetu_s. Unlike Unmaada, there is no special category of Apasmaara due to Aagantu factors. Only additional symptoms are manifested in the four types of Apasmaara, when they are associated with the Doshaja types of Apasmaara. When the Apasmaara is associated with the Aagantu factors, it needs to be treated with such therapies, that would bring the vitiated Doshaa_s to their normal state; also simultaneously therapies that can correct the Aagantu factors. According to some Aachaarya, Apasmaara is not caused by Dosha_s but it is Aagantu as it appears suddenly without any apparent cause and it also subsides on its own without any treatment. There is also scriptural evidence that Apasmaara is Aagantu and not Doshaja. But there are other views, which prove that Apasmaara is Doshaja only and not Aagantuja. Dosha_s are responsible for this disease as they are gradually aggravated. These Dosha_s are momentarily aggravated, which when paroxysm gets reduced themselves and it looks as if the disease is cured without any treatment.

This part of the colon, which is four and half Angula in length includes anal opening, which is half Angula (figure) in length. Ars`ha is manifested in this area. Types of Ars`ha: Types of Ars`ha according to various texts: Sahaja Ars`ha According to Charaka and Sus`ruta Ars`ha could be congenital in nature. They are termed as Sahaja Ars`ha. (Saha Jaataani S`hareeren`a). Sahaja Ars`ha: Sampraapti: Unwholesome dietary and behavioral regimes (also sinful acts of past life) of mother and father leads to impaired part of Beeja (S`hukra and S`hon`ita), which is responsible for Gudavalee formation. This leads to deformity in anal region to manifest congenital piles (Sahaja Ars`ha) These reasons are applicable not only to the Ars`ha but to all the other diseases also, which are caused by the Beeja Dusht`i. Other types are based on Dosha dominance and are important for treatment decisions. S`hushka Ars`ha = Vaata and Kapha Dominance Sraavee Ars`ha = Rakta and Pitta Dominance Related Sampraapti factors Generally, this disease is caused by vitiation of Maamsa Dhaatu (Adhi Maamsa Vikaara) with vitiation of three Dosha. (i.e. it is Tridoshaja Vikaara). Meda and Tvak are other involved factors in the all types of Ars`ha. This growth (Ars`ha) appears in various sizes and shapes as long, short, round, irregularly spread, matted together etc. Their characteristic colours are according the involved Dosha. Ars`ha Sampraapti: Apaana Vaayu gets aggravated due to causative factors. (Person having Mandaagni is prone to Ars`ha.) The aggravated Apaana Vaayu brings down the accumulated waste products (Upachita Mala). This aggravation of Dosha and Rakta takes place. These aggravated Dosha (all three Dosha) move along with the course of Pradhaana Dhamanee (Pureeshavaahee) in the downward direction. These Dosha get located in Guda and vitiate Guda valee producing the muscular growth or piles (Maamsapraroha). Apaana Vaayu gets obstructed by the growth of Maamsa Dhaatu in the anal canal. Due to this obstruction Apaana Vaayu moves upwards and aggravates Samaana, Vyaana, Praan`a and Udaana Vaayu. All the aggravated five types of Vaayu, Pitta and Kapha are responsible for the disease like Ars`ha. A person with Ars`ha gets all the diseases caused by Vaayu (Vaata Vikaara) Pitta and Kapha Vikaara are also manifested as there is aggravation of Pitta and Kapha also. Clinical presentation (Lakshan`a) of Ars`ha: Presence of piles or hemorrhoids is cardinal sign of Ars`ha. The prodromal symptoms of Ars`ha may mislead a physician with the diseases like Udara, Grahan`ee, Paan`d`u. The signs and symptoms of Ars`ha get manifested in accordance with the dominance of the Dosha. Other signs include: Udaavarta is the main complication. Gravels and stone in the urinary tract. Sharp shooting /cutting pain at umbilicus and around urinary bladder and pelvis, anal pain. Pravaahikaa, Pariharsha, Prameha, Visht`ambha (constipation), Antrakoojana (hyper peristaltic sound), Hridaya Upalepa, Indriya Upalepa. At times he gets excessive belching associated with bitter and sour taste. Excessive generalized weakness with depleted digestive power. Depleted state of S`hukra Dhaatu (semen) These patients are agitated and are difficult to treat. Other symptoms include: Kaasa, S`hvaasa, Tamaka S`hvaasa, Trishn`aa, Hrillaasa, Chhardee, Arochaka, Avipaaka, Peenasa, Kshavathu, malaise, Jvara (fever), oedema on hands, feet, face and Akshikoot`a, Paars`hva, Kukshi, Hridaya, Prisht`ha, Trika Taimirika: patient feels as if he is entering into darkness and suffers from headache.

(ear complainants) Specific complications (Upadrava) of Ars`ha: Ars`ha is to be treated immediately. Otherwise they produce Baddha Gudodara (obstruction to anal canal.) Other sites of Ars`ha Though the term Ars`ha means piles or hemorrhoids, various muscular growths like polyps are also described as Ars`ha due to similarity in pathogenesis. Ars`ha might occur at several other locations like S`hisna (penis), Apatya Patha (female genital tract), Gala (throat), Taalu (palate), Mukha (mouth), Naasaa (nose), Karn`a (ears), Akshi Vartma (eyelids), Tvak (skin) etc. Each type is described as follows: Med`hra Ars`ha Aggravated Dosha vitiate Maamsa and S`hon`ita of penis. It causes itching. The wound is formed due to scratching. In this wound, the vitiated Maamsa grow out on the glans penis, which lead to the deformity in the penis and causes Pumstva Upaghaata (impotency). Yoni Ars`ha Aggravated Dosha produce muscular growths in the vagina which destruct Aartava and normal functioning of vagina and anal related structures. Naabhi Ars`ha Aggravated Dosha produce muscular growths in the umbilical region. Karn`a Ars`ha Aggravated Dosha tend to develop Ars`ha in the ear causing deafness, pain and suppuration in ear. (For details, please refer Karn`a Roga) Netra Ars`ha Ars`ha formed on the eyelid cause difficulty in movements of eyelid, manifests symptoms like pain, lacrimation . It may hamper vision also. Naasaa Ars`ha It develops internal cavity of nose, causes Pratis`hyaaya, sneezing, difficulty in exhalation, Pootinasya, nasal voice (Anunaasika Vaakya), headache. (For details, please refer Naasaa Roga) Mukha Ars`ha It causes Gadgad Vaak (obstructed and deep voice ), Rasa Adnyaana (tastelessness) and diseases of mouth. Charmakeela The aggravated Vyaana Vaayu with Kapha produces stable muscular growth like Keela (nail) on the surface of the skin. In Charmakeela there is pricking pain and dryness due to Vaayu. It looks blackish red due to Pitta. It is oily and glandular due to Kapha. (For details, please refer Kshudra Roga) Saadhya - Asaadhyatva: Ars`ha is difficult to cure.

The movement of the Pureesha gets increased. It is serious disease. Mythological origin: In Kritayuga (Aadikaala) animals were brought near for sacrificial rite / ceremony but they were not sacrificed / killed. At the time after the sacrificial rites were carried out by Daksha (in Daksha Yadnya / Kratu), the sons of Manu also carried out Kratu. The sons of Manu were Narishyat, Aabhaaga, Ikshvaaku, Nriga, S`haryaati. In the sacrificial rites (Kratu) of the sons of Manu, animals allowed themselves to be sacrificed. So they are sacrificed with proper prayers / rituals. ( Prokshan`a  Vidhipoorvakam Maaran`am) It has been said in the Veda that one who sacrifices and one who gets sacrificed both become liable for moral and religious merits (Pun`ya) That is the reason why animals allowed themselves to get sacrificed. In the descendent time Prishadhra, son of Manu organized another sacrificial rite for a very long period. He was unable to get the animals for the sacrifice. So, he sacrificed cows instead of animals. Cow is a religious and respected animal in Indian customs and traditions. Hence when cows were sacrificed, living beings were afflicted by sadness as cows were never sacrificed before this. They were sacrificed for the first time in the sacrificial rite of Prishadhra. Meat of these ritually sacrificed cows were eaten by people (as Purod`aas`ha). Being heavy (Guru), hot (Ushn`a), unwholesome (Asaatmya), ineffable, and unwished (As`hasta Upayogaat) the capacity of digestive fire was reduced (Agni Upahanana) and caused destruction of minds (Mano Upahanana) These led to Atisaara in the Kratu of Prishadhra. This story suggests that causative factors of Atisaara are Mano Upaghaata and consumption of unwholesome diet having attributes like Guru etc. Nirukti: Atisaran`am Atisaarah | S.

Passage of watery stool is cardinal sign of this disease. Types according to various texts Other types (mentioned by Asht`aanga Hridaya) are Sarakta and Nirakta There are no Dvandvaja Atisaara (Vyaadhisvabhaavaat) described. However, Haarita have quoted Dvandvaja types of Atisaara, moreover in Chikitsaa such types are described. But they are not supported by Sus`hruta. According toD`alhan`a in Doshaja Atisaara, there is association of another Dosha; hence it creates a picture of Dvandvaja type. But it can be considered as a specific condition in Atisaara (Avasthaa). Sampraapti Causative factors hamper Agni also cause Aapa Dhaatu Dusht`ee. Body fluids (Apaam Dhaatuh Kaaya Drava) further lower digestive capacity and gets mixed with the Pureesha. Aggravated Vaayu moves down the body fluid (Abdhaatu) causing Atisaara. Description of each type: Vaataja Atisaara Vaayu gets aggravated in a person who is of Vaataja constitution, and who indulges in Vaata aggravating diet and behavior. It hampers the capacity to digest (Paktaa Upahanyate) The Sweat and Urine both are brought into the Pakvaas`haya (Pureeshaas`haya), which lead to increase in liquidity of stools (Pureesham Draveekritya) These liquefied stools pass through Guda, which is termed as Vaataja Atisaara. Though Aama and Pakva types are subtypes of Vaataja Atisaara, all types of Atisaara in their prior stage may have Aamaavasthaa and in later stage Pakvaavasthaa. Pittaja Atisaara Pitta gets aggravated in a person who is of Pittaja constitution, and who indulges in Pitta aggravating diet and behaviour. This aggravated Pitta with its liquidity (Drava attribute) lowers the capacity of digestive fire to digest and enters into the Pakvaas`haya (Pureeshaas`haya Visritam). Due to its Sara and Drava attribute it shatters (Bhinna) and liquefies the stools, which pass through anus causing Pittaja Atisaara. Kaphaja Atisaara Kapha gets aggravated in a person who is of Kapha constitution, indulges in Kapha aggravating diet and behaviour. Due to its attributes like Guru, S`heeta, Madhura, Snigdha, it lowers the capacity of the digestive fire. With its cold attribute it affects Pureesha in Pureeshaas`haya. It moistens the Pureesha, which passes through anus causing Kaphaja Atisaara. Tridoshaja Atisaara In a person whose digestive capacity is reduced and who indulges in causative factors aggravating all the three Dosha, digestive capacity gets reduced totally. These aggravated Dosha enter into the Pakvaas`haya, which manifests in Atisaara with symptoms and signs of all the three Dosha. Saannipaatika Atisaara is Krichchhrasaadhya and Asaadhya in children and old persons. Sudden cure from Saannipaatika Atisaara is one of its Asaadhya Lakshan`a. Aagantu Atisaara (Bhayaja and S`hokaja) Due to Bhaya (Fear) and S`hoka (Sorrow) Vaayu gets aggravated. This aggravated Vaayu causes Atisaara. Sorrow or grief and hunger reduce digestive capacity of the person. Rakta Dhaatu gets irritated. (Kshobha) Then with difficulty Pureesha passes through Guda with difficulty. Pureesha resembles red colour of Gunjaa When mind is irritated by fear, Vaayu with Pitta increases liquidity in Pureesha. This Vaayu expels out the Pureesha causing Bhayaja Atisaara. Aamaja Atisaara In a person having Aamaajeern`a, vitiated Dosha irritate Koshth`a. These Dosha pass out through anus manifesting different coloured Pureesha and with undigested food material causing Aamaja Atisaara. Aama Atisaara When Pureesha is associated with Dosha, it sinks into the water, it has excessive bad odour, it does not pass at one time completely (Alpa Alpa Pravartakam) and when it is excessively sticky (Pichchhila) the diagnosis is AamaAtisaara.

To manage any situation effectively it is imperative that one diagnosis it correctly in the first place. It is imperative to study the cause and the signs produced by them. The signs and symptoms under evaluation are physical, psychological, functional, structural, indicating complication or terminality of the disease. This study is the Nidaana while the management of the condition forms the Aushadha part. Various authors have described various methods of evaluation and we see a gradual evolution in the methods as Aakriti while later authors include them in their repertoire. This article would introduce the concept in brief to orient the reader with the logical and the complex structure of Ayurvedic diagnostics. There are two aspects to diagnosis the person who is suffering and the diseases he is suffering from. It is essential to evaluate both of them. We shall first elaborate about the patient. There are various ways described by the texts like Vaagbhat`a advises Trividha Pareekshaa, it comprises of: Dars`hana or inspection, the examination carried out without actually touching the person. This gives an idea about the predominant Dosha and it indicates those Lakshan`a_s / signs and symptoms which the patient cannot hide along with their location. These are signs and symptoms elicited using all other sense organs other than touch. Various signs and symptoms evident by inspection are as under: Varn`a / skin color  The skin color, it could be normal according to the constitution or it could be affected by the ongoing disease process like in Paan`d`u  Ketakee Dhoolisannibha Varn`a / skin resembling the dull yellowish color of the pandanus flower, or it becomes like turmeric in Kaamalaa / Jaundice. Kaanti, Prabhaa / skin luster - The skin luster is dependent upon the Rasa Dhaatu and Jaat`haraagni, hence any malfunction of Agni and contamination of Rasa results in lackluster skin e.g. Nishprabha Tvak of Rasa Asaarataa Jihvaa / tongue - inspection of tongue Kesh`a / body hair Nakha / nails Svara / voice Netra / eyes Spanda / pulsation e.g. carotid in the neck, claudication, tremors, twitching etc and normally at Marma points, these are visible pulsation S`hotha / swelling, oedema, localized or generalized, Vran`a, Vran`asraava, Bhagna, Sandhimukta etc. Aakriti / physique, Well built / Sunivisht`a Maamsa S`hon`ita, Emaciated / Anivisht`a Maamsa S`hon`ita Wasted / Tvagaasthis`hesha Debility Preoccupied / Vyagra Stressed / Udvigna Siraajaalayuta / visible and prominent vessels, Decuitus postures adopted by the patient Svinnagaatra Dr.Vilas Nanal Sr. Scientist AyuSoft.

Vitiated Udaana Vaayu expels out all the three aggravated Dosha through mouth manifesting Chhardi. Vaatajaa Chhardi: Due to the causative factors like exercise, high potency drugs, sorrow (S`hoka), fear, fasting, Vaayu gets aggravated in the Annavaha Srotas. This aggravated Vaayu excites other Dosha (Utkles`ha) and force them in the upward direction. The Dosha are excited in the stomach (Aamaas`haya) causing pain in the Marma Sthaana (vital spots) Thus, Dosha are expelled out through the mouth. There is vigorous belching.

The concept of Karmaja diseases, being only from Ayurveda viewpoint or from the spiritual Indian literature, there may not be an exact word in English to translate it. The nearest word is affliction or (misery). Karmaja means the unavoidable effect of acts committed in the previous birth. Out of the different types of classifications of diseases, one of the classifications puts diseases into 3 types: Doshaja that is due to unbalanced Tridosha_s (Vaata-Pitta-Kapha) which constitutes the basic body structure Karmaja are due to sinful acts done in this or the past life Dosha-Karmaja where a combination of the above causes are involved (Ref2) More clarification: Doshaja diseases Are those where we can find out the cause behind the real facts such as diet, behavior etc. Signs and symptoms are clear and relevant to cause and pathological reports. Treatment gives relief as per expectation. We can judge prognosis. Karmaja disease - where we cannot find the root cause at the material level. Signs and symptoms are similar like Doshaja disease, and we can name it. But, treatment does not give relief. Disease may disappear automatically. That is when the effect of accumulated sins becomes weak. Doshakarmaja diseases where manifestation of disease is larger as compared to its known cause. Treatment gives only partial relief. At the practical level when a patient comes in front of a physician expecting successful treatment, physician and patient both are ignorant about what part of disease is affliction i.e. effect of previous sinful acts. Theoretically, to differentiate between the Doshaja and the Karmaja diseases, one has to find out the cause of the disease and its relevance to sign and symptoms. But it is a difficult job. Most of the time it depends upon a history given by the patient. So the physician prefers to diagnose according to signs and symptoms, if necessary with support of investigations and starts the treatment. If the response is as per expectations, then there is no problem. But if it is not, still the physician doubts that the diagnosis or treatment may not be proper and therefore tries another treatment. (Ref.3). If the illness still persists, being an Ayurvedician and one who accepts its theory he may consider it as a Karmaja or Affliction-type disease. That raises a dilemma, whether medical treatment is to be given or not? To come out of this dilemma one needs some determination to act, with an irrevocable logic behind it. It is the moral duty of a physician to treat a patient of any condition and do his best (Ref.4). There are other reasons why an affliction type of disease should be treated. Before going into reasoning some clarification about afflictions is necessary. If any one wants a good life, he or she should not commit any sinful act, not only physically but also verbally and mentally. The following are some sinful acts listed in the Asht`aanga Hridaya-Sootrasthaan chapter no which a person must refrain from: Killing Theft Sexual misconduct Malicious reporting or contentious Hurting words Lying Nonsense talk Hostile mentality Hatred, intolerance Logical invalid mentality There are the inner motives of mind, which are to be controlled by men consciously; otherwise they become the cause of the above said sinful acts. Examples of some inner motives are: Greed-affection Hatred intolerance Anger Rivalry Lamentation grief Passion Obstinacy or vanity Hypocrisy In this connection we should understand that each action whether by deed, word or thought leaves behind an impact called Samskaara or karma. An accumulation of deeds, act as supply source of energy to sustain life. This goes to the credit or debit account of individual according to whether action is good or bad. Bad or misdeeds sinful acts turn into suffering, mostly as disease, which is inevitably followed by suffering and death. In such a case a physician who believes the above theory should talk frankly his doubt to the patient. That is, his disease may not be cured only by medical treatment, but needs support of changed mentality. For his disease, there is no known cause; it may be an effect of his previous wrong acts. But do not try now to analyze them as it may create a stress, which will worsen the disease. Accept the condition only as it is. Live with good virtues. Everything is reversible, so affliction will also end. Analyzing previous deeds and its effect is an inscrutable job and (Ref.7) only enlightened persons can do it. Medical treatment will be required as there is no instant method of diagnosis by which one can decide that this is an affliction type disease. Then practical way is to start the treatment with assumed diagnosis and conclude according to positive or negative results (Ref.3). There are many diseases described even in the modern medical texts of unknown etiology. Their origin may be hidden in a persons impaired mental act or misdeed. These may have happened in the past or may be from the previous life. Fatal types of diseases, such as cancer, without any known cause, especially at an early age, may be Karmaja disease. Chronic disease, especially skin troubles, Lucoderma, asthma, migraine relates to the concept of responsible affliction. We observe in practice that patients who face the disease and treatment with calm and a quiet mind suffer minimum and get cured. Ayurvedic method of treatment work on both mind and body. One who accepts the systematic Ayurvedic treatment means that he is ready to change his mentality. One who wants to delude his mind and is not ready to go to the root cause and wants superficial easy type of treatment is likely to take longer to heal. Compared to the modern method of treatment. Ayurvedic approach is a tedious job. To undergo purification of the body (Panchakarma) may be a disgusting experience for many. Prior to emesis (Vamana) etc, it requires oleation (intake of high dose of oil or ghee) for about 7 days. This requires tolerance. Medicine of bitter taste, unacceptable smells, leech application, fast or diet restrictions long duration of treatment, support of yogic exercises; whenever necessary, are all parts of the Ayurvedic treatment. There is a synonym-word Praayas`hchitta (Ref.8) for a treatment, which has a sense of expiation. (Remedy for sinful act). Understanding the base of afflictions, change in attitude rooting out possible body impurities through Panchakarma are useful to obtain quick relief. There are certain rites and rituals, which claim as remedy for afflictions. Humble suggestion, is that these should be accepted only if it has a strong logical support and nobody exploits you with it. I practice personally Vipas`hyanaa type of meditation that is fully logical. It is taught in various centers across the world without any formal charges. Objective of this meditation is to make a strong and pure mind until complete liberalization from mental bondages, this meditation is no doubt a difficult job, but any one can follow it after strong determination and can get rapid results in controlling mind and getting over the afflictions, thus the method is also partly described in Ayurveda (Ref.9). A Vipas`hyanaa mediator is expected to refrain from all misdeeds, that lead to all sinful acts, so, further accumulation will not take place. At the time of meditation, in a noble silence one has to sit in a comfortable cross leg posture with closed yes. For concentration of mind one has to only observe ingoing and outgoing respiration at the entrance of nostrils. Support of any media, like uttering holy name, counting of numbers, idol imagination, Praanaayaama is strictly prohibited. After some practice of concentration, mind becomes subtle to know senses, which are taking place in the body and mind every moment. While observing all the body parts through senses, one becomes aware of changes taking place and its impermanence. Sensory nervous system is in contact of mind and body matter. Neutral observation of body and mind though internal sense (touch) is an experiential knowledge. Neutral observation means not to react bodily or mentally to any sense present in body whether it is pleasing, distressing or neutral and the impermanence of every existence whether good or bad becomes clearer and clearer. One learns that to take interest. (To have or have not) in such phenomenon is a misery and by experience gets rid of it (Ref.9). While this process is on, old accumulated defilements (effect of sinful acts) stands in front of mind. Due to no further reactions they become consumed like diet for mind. Thus he gets relieved from afflictions. Vipas`hyanaa is supportive to medial treatment for Karmaja diseases or may be only remedy for Karmaja diseases. In day-to day practice, patient of any type or condition may come in front of a physician. He cannot disappoint him and feel helpless. There is a role for him even in Karmaja diseases. By having proper understanding he can treat patient with high moral.

Ni. 20, A.H.U.3,4. Introduction: Charaka has explained it under Unmaada, as Aagantu Unmaada is caused due to the exogenous factors like Graha. Causative factor for the Aagantu Unmaada is Apras`hasta Karma which is caused due to the Pradnyaaparaadha. Due to Pradnyaaparaadha, a person insults the respected ones like Deva, Rishi, Pitri, Gandharva, Yaksha (living supernatural being / ghost), Raakshasa (demonical), Pis`haacha (class of demons, possibly so called either from their fondness for flesh), Guru (any venerable or respectable), Vriddha (experienced), Siddha (accomplished), Aachaarya (a spiritual guide or teacher), Poojya (an honorable man) etc. and they cause Unmaada. Hetu Pradnyaaparaadha is the only cause of the Bhoota Graha. These Graha seize a person whenever they found any misconduct in the behavior / blemish behavior. Graha affect due to following motives. Himsaa (Asaadhya) Rati ( Saadhya ) Abhyarchana ( Saadhya) Favorable conditions for Grahabaadha: These Graha seize a person in the following situations. Many of these situations denote improper behavior. Charaka has said that though these Graha, actually do not affect person unless and until he behaves wrongly. When person is cursed by Guru, Vriddha, Siddha, Maharshi etc. A person looks deceased ancestors (Pitri Dars`hana) A person touches Gandharva Paapa Kriyaa Aarambha (sinful act) Ultimate effect of Anisht`a Karma Lonely appearance of a person in crematorium Digvaasah (when a person is nude) Guru Nindaa (outraging the teachers) Avidhi Rati Sevana Para Sootaka Sankara Dinacharyaa Vyatikrama As`huchi (poor hygiene) Bhinna Maryaadaa (not following the conduct and order) Kshata (wounded condition) Himsaa (mischief) Vihaara (enjoyment / pleasure) Satkaara (for kind treatment / religious observance) Classification of Graha Roga Charaka classifies Graha Roga as Aagantu Unmaada. While Sus`hruta and Vaagbhat`a describe this condition as Graha Roga. According to Charaka: Aagantu Unmaada (Deva Unmaada) S`haapa Unmaada Pitri Graha Unmaada Gandharva Unmaada Yaksha Unmaada Raakshasa Unmaada BrahmaRaakshasa Unmaada Pis`haacha Unmaada According to Sus`hruta: Sus`hruta has mentioned that there are 9 Baala Graha and 8 other Graha, which can seize the adults also.

It means that there is sudden change in to the Dnyaana (Knowledge), Vidnyaana (intelligence), Vaak (speech), Chesht`aa (behaviour), Bala (strength) and Paurusha (masculinity). When person is affected by Graha of Himsaa, a person behaves abnormally. He enters in to the fire, sinks in to the water, jumps in to the chasm; he beats himself with rope etc. He may try to suicide. It is Asaadhya. Demoniac possession (Bhoota Graha) can be judged by the signs that a person seized by the Graha behaves and appears same as of the characters of the Bhoota in respect to Roopa, Prakriti, Bhaashaa, Gati, Chesht`aa. This Amaanusha Upasarga (trouble by the super-humans) can be judged by the superhuman behavior of a person who is seized by the Graha.

The disease in which physiology of Grahan`ee is hampered is called as Grahan`ee. Svaroopa: Grahan`ee Dosha means that Dosha which are situated in Grahan`ee. Agnimaandya and Ajeern`a are the diseases which are manifested in Grahan`ee, but here only 4 types are included as Grahan`ee Dosha as typical destruction of Grahan`ee. In these diseases Grahan`ee gets disturbed physiologically. Grahan`ee is site of Agni (digestive power) and as it holds the food (Grahan`a) it is called as Grahan`ee. It is the sixth Kalaa, which is also called as Pittadharaa Kalaa. It is related to umbilical region. Grahan`ee gets strength due to this digestive power (Agni) and so it holds the undigested food and when gets digested is passed on. This function of Grahan`ee is hampered when Agni Dusht`i happens (lowered capacity of digestive fire to digest) and then Grahan`ee passes undigested food as it is. Grahan`ee is disturbed when a person indulges in the causes which reduce the capacity to digest (Agni). It may happen that a person cured of Atisaara having less digestive capacity, when consumes unwholesome diet, his / her Grahan`ee is affected. Therefore, it is necessary that a person should obey the restrictions like a purgated person (Viriktavat), till he becomes strong enough and the Dosha get reduced. Actually, strength of Grahan`ee is nothing but digestive capacity (Agni) which resides in it, so when Agni gets distorted, necessarily Grahan`ee also gets distorted. Nirukti: Grahan`yaah rogo Grahan`ee Rogah | M. N. 4.2,3 T`eekaa The disease of Grahan`ee is Grahan`ee or Grahan`ee Dosha. Synonym: It is also denoted by Grahan`ee Dosha. Types: Vaataja Pittaja Kaphaja Saannipaatika Actually, Grahan`ee Dosha resembles to Ajeern`a. Agni Dusht`i is a major factor in Grahan`ee Dosha. Charakaachaarya has explained four types of Agni in Rogaaneeka Vimaana. They are Teekshn`a Agni Manda Agni Vishama Agni Sama Agni Amongst these excluding Sama Agni, all three types are the imbalance in digestive capacity. These all can be treated as Grahan`ee Dosha. Sama Agni is a cause of healthy status of a person. Sampraapti: Due to indigestion (Ajeern`a), eating in excess amount (Atibhojana), Vishamaas`hana etc. digestive capacity is hampered. (Agni Dush`i) Easily digestible food material also can not be digested by a person. Therefore, the food turns acidic (S`huktatva - Amlataam) The food resembles to poison as a poison is a cause of many diseases, this undigested food is also a cause of many diseases. Actually, all types of Ajeern`a are categorized in this, viz. Aamaajeern`a, Vidagdhaajeern`a, Visht`abdhaajeern`a, Rasas`heshaajeern`a. This Annavisha when gets associated with Vaata, Pitta or Kapha it manifests with the symptoms according to the Dosha. If it gets associated with Mootra it causes Mootraroga; when gets associated with Pureesha, it manifests with Kukshi roga. When it gets associated with Dhaatu like Rasa etc. then it causes diseases respected to that Dhaatu. In Grahan`ee the food is partly digested and partly undigested i. e. Vidaaha. Grahan`ee passes the food either digested (Pakva) or indigested (Aama). Lakshan`a: (Poorvaroopa - Upadrava): In Poorva Roopa Avasthaa Grahan`ee passes Pakva and Apakva food, in Roopa Avasthaa it passes only Aama food. When aggravated Dosha, singly or collectively distort Grahan`ee, then it passes the undigested food for many times. It may pass digested food also. There is pain in abdomen associated with it. It becomes foul smelled. It may be properly formed due to Vaata or liquefied due to Pitta. This is a disease which is called as Grahan`ee. The formed bowel may pass suddenly and repeatedly without any cause or unformed bowel may pass suddenly and repeatedly without any cause. This situation may remain for a long period because of accumulation of bowel (Sanchayaat Cha Upaves`hayet) Sangraha Grahan`ee It is very complicated to treat, rather incurable and chronic in nature. It aggravates in day time and pacifies in night. The causative factor behind this is Aama, Vaata or Saama Vaata. When a person sleeps a person feels pain in the flanks (Paars`hva S`hoola) and there is a sound like pouring of water through a vessel (Jala Ghat`ee Dhvani) This is also called as Ghat`ee Yantra or Sangraha Grahan`ee.

Introduction: The term Gulma literally means a bush which is round in shape and a compact mass. It is characterized by Pain (Vedanaa) as most important symptom. This is important differentiating criterion. Vitiated Vaata is an invariable causative factor for all types of Gulma. Gulma can be judged by five diagnostic factors viz., Samutthaana, Poorvaroopa, Linga, Vedanaa, Upas`haya. Here, Sampraapti is not mentioned, as it does not help in ascertaining the specific features of Gulma. Gulma is like a Granthi (lump), in the region between heart and bladder. It may be movable or immovable. It may increase or decrease. It is round (Vritta  Vartula) in shape. Gulma does not suppurate as it grows within itself like bubble in the water. It grows in its site (organ), the Dosha moves from organ to the cave of Gulma and Gulma to organ, therefore it does not suppurate. Generally, Vaataja Gulma does not suppurate whereas other types of Gulma may suppurate, as they are associated with Rakta etc. Dhaatu. It is dry, black and covered with a network of veins (Siraajaala Gavaakshita). Nirukti: Sa Pin`d`itatvaat Gulma Iti Uchyate | C. Ni. 3/7 Paripin`d`tatvaat Gulmo | C.

Owing to its complex and organized nature, owing to its deep rooted nature, it is termed as Gulma. It has unknown cause. It can not be diagnosed at earlier stage (D`alhan`a) Types of Gulma Dvandvaja Gulma (Gulma due to combination of two Dosha) is not separately explained because these type manifest according to the Dosha and they are curable (Saadhya). Nichaya Gulama (Sannipaata Gulma) is separately narrated as it is manifested from all the three Dosha but it remains incurable (Asaadhya). Instead of Sannipaata, the word Nichaya (it means accumulation of high order) is used to state the highest incurable status of this type of Gulma. For Jvara, Sannipaata word is used as it may be curable, but Nichaya (assemblage of Dosha) Gulma is incurable. In case where the symptomatology of two Dosha combinations is logical, predictable that texts do not describe it even though such conditions are found in practice. In these situations arising from two Dosha combinations where the symptomatology is hard to explain, understand, they are described by the sages. Raktaja Gulma, which occurs in males, is due to vitiation of Rakta Dhaatu. It is not separately told, as it is included in Pittaja Gulma due to same symptoms. In females, Raktaja Gulma, may occur due to vitiation of Rakta Dhaatu (likewise in males) or Aartava Rakta. According to Kshaarapaan`i, Aartavaja Gulma (Raktaja Gulma) never happens in males whereas Raktaja (Rakta Dhaatuja) Gulma happens in both, male and female. (M.N.28/3 Madhukosha). Sites of Gulma: There are 5 sites at which Gulma can occur. Basti (Urinary Bladder) Naabhi (Umbilical region) Hridya (Heart) Two Paars`hva (Flanks)  the hepatic and splenic flexures of colon. Raktaja Gulma is counted in Paars`hva (flank) region as Paars`hva is indicative of Garbhaas`haya Paars`hva also. Saamaanya Sampraapti: The vitiated Vaata provokes either Kapha or Pitta or both of them. Along with them Vaayu obstructs the channels of circulation (Urdhva, Adho and Tiryag Maarga) to cause pain. This pain occurs in one or more regions of heart, umbilicus, flank, abdomen and urinary bladder. It is not eliminated through the downward (also upward and transverse path) path because of obstruction; it remains confined to Pakvaas`haya, Pitaas`haya, Kaphaas`haya either independently, singly (Svatantra) or in association with other Dosha (Paratantra). It becomes palpable because of its round shape for which it is called Gulma. Depending upon the Dosha involved in the manifestation of this ailment, it is classified in to several categories. In the pathogenesis of all types of Gulma, Vaayu plays the primary role. It is primarily located in Pakvaas`haya. Hence, while manifesting in Pakvaas`haya, it remains independent (Svatantra). Pittaas`haya and Kaphaas`haya are primary abodes of Pitta and Kapha respectively. Hence, while manifesting Gulma in Pittas`haya and Kaaphaas`hya, Vaayu becomes dependent (Parasams`hraya) on other Dosha. Vaataja Gulma Sampraapti: This pathogenesis happens in Vaata Prakriti person who is exceedingly emaciated due to Jvara, emesis (Vamana) or purgation (Virechana). In above conditions when a person indulges in Vaata aggravating factors, Vaata gets aggravated. This aggravated Vaayu when enters the digestive tract (Mahaa Srotas). Due to its dryness (Raukshya), it makes the digestive tract hard or stiff (Kat`hina). This aggravated Vaayu makes a site there, which rolls in to a ball or lump, becomes dense (Pin`d`ita) by pervading in the digestive tract (Aaplutya) This Vaayu takes up the place in heart, bladder (Basti), flank (Paars`hva), umbilical region (Naabhi) It produces colic pain (S`hoola), various types of protuberances (Granthee). It remains in the round form (Pin`d`tah avatisht`hate) [aggravated Vaata takes a round shape]; there is enlargement or growth of Maamsa Dhaatu at the site of Gulma; hence disease is called as Gulma. Pittaja Gulma Sampraapti: Pitta gets aggravated with Vaata in a person who is emaciated due to either Jvara, emesis (Vamana), purgation (Virechana) due to Pitta aggravating factors. This aggravated Vaayu gets localized in a part of stomach and small intestine (Aamaas`haya), which has got dryness due to the causative factors It produces different types of pains as described to manifest in Vaataja Gulma. Pittaja Gulma does not manifest in Basti. Kaphaja Gulma Sampraapti: Kapha gets aggravated along with Vaayu in an individual who is emaciated due to Jvara, emesis (Vamana), purgation (Virechana) This aggravated Vaata gets localized in a part of stomach and intestine (Aamaas`haya), which has got dryness due to the causative factors. It produces pains as described in Vaata Gulma. When Kaphaja Gulma is seriously increased, Raajayakshmaa is seen as a specific nature of this disease, though all the three Dosha are not vitiated. Nichaya (Sannipaata) Gulma Sampraapti: Saannipaatika Gulma is caused by the causative factors responsible for vitiation of all the three Dosha. The symptoms of all viz. Vaata, Pitta, Kaphaja Gulma are seen in this Gulma. This is incurable (Asaadhya) due to mutual contradiction of Dosha involved in its treatment. Raktaja Gulma Sampraapti: In woman who indulges in unwholesome diet just after delivery or aborts immature foetus or in menstrual period, Vaayu obstructs menstrual blood producing Gulma. This Gulma happens due to vitiation of Rakta, only in females because of the characteristic feature to pass the menstrual blood through uterus. Vaata gets aggravated due to the Vaata aggravating factors in females. This aggravated Vaata enters in to the cervix of uterus and obstructs the menstrual blood. This obstructed menstrual blood flow goes up every month. As a result, there is distension of the womb or lower abdomen. There is pulsation (Spandana) in the entire mass which is round in shape. It is painful and with burning sensation. Its symptoms are similar to Pittaja Gulma.

Amongst them, S`hvaasa and Hikkaa are the two, because of which a man leads to the death very quickly. A person experiences great pain inconvenience at the time of death. The disease is manifested with the dominance of Kapha and Vaata. The pathogenesis of the disease starts from the Pitta Sthaana i. e. Aamaas`haya. Hikkaa manifests with sudden, continuous and repeated high toned spasmodic sounds with the seizing of throat. This sound may be heard once, twice or thrice at one time. The sound is so loud and the Vaata is so quick that a person feels as if his liver, spleen and intestines are being thrown out.

Hikkaa manifests with sudden, perpetual and repeated high toned spasmodic sounds with the seizing of throat. This sound may be heard once, twice or thrice at one time. There is obstruction of Praan`a, Srotas and Marma Sthaana like Basti, Hridaya, S`hira etc. There is loss of senses (Sandnyaa Naas`ha), stiffness in the body parts and memory loss. This is a serious condition. The sound produced is very loud, the strength of the disease is more, the paroxysm of the Hikkaa is acute and it manifests due to the severity of Dosha; therefore it is called as Mahaa Hikkaa. It leads to the death. Gambheeraa Hikkaa: There is a big sound of Hiccup with deep reverberation of sound (Gambheera Anunaada) there is yawing, stiffness. The pathogenesis of this type of Hikkaa originates from Naabhi (Umbilicus) and Pakvaas`haya. There is difficulty in exhalation which leads to the death. In Gambheeraa Hikkaa many complications are seen afterwards like Jvara, Trishn`aa etc. Vyapetaa Hikkaa: Yaa Hikkaa Yamalaih Vegaih Pravartate Saa Yamalaa Hikkaa | T`eekaa S.

This Hikkaa is sounded twice at a time. There is tremor in neck and head. Kshudra Hikkaa: Aggravation of Vaata is relatively less than other types of Hikkaa. Vaayu form Kosht`ha traverse to the throat (Kan`t`ha) due to exercise manifesting Kshudra Hikkaa. By name it denotes that this type of Hikkaa is not serious; it is mild but subsides by the regimen by which the Hikkaa is manifested. Exercise itself reduces the Hikkaa which is a cause of Kshudra Hikkaa. According to Sus`hruta Kshudraa Hikkaa originates from the root of Jatru. Annajaa Hikkaa: Upward direction of Vaata from Kosht`ha is caused due to sudden intake of food, liquid, liquor, excessive talk, walking, laughing, carrying load etc. This Vaayu harbors in the chest causing Annajaa Hikkaa. This subsides after eating food or drinking liquid. There is a sneezing after the sound of Hikkaa. Sampraapti: Vaayu gets aggravated in the Praan`avaha Srotas. This aggravated Vaata vitiate Kapha.

V. Joshi, M.D., Ph.D. (Ayu.), M.A. M.Phil (Sanskrit) Hetu, Linga and Aushadha are collectively known as Trisootra. It is supposed that each description in Ayurvedic Samhitas come under one of three categories, related either to healthy state or to diseased condition. Each of them is a topic of detailed twofold study. Importance of Hetudnyaana Avoidance of the cause, in short, is called as Treatment. This quotation from Sus`hruta Samhitaa is enough to depict the importance of Hetudnyaana with various aspects. Everyone knows that avoidance of cause affects the further progress of the effect. Same is the case for Roga Hetu & Roga. One should exclude Aagantuja Vyaadhi from this; but in Nija Vyaadhi, symptoms get subsided after the avoidance of causes and the cure is achievable. Severity of symptoms depends upon Hetubala i.e. strength of Hetu and also on the condition of body. If causes are not avoided then severity may increase or prolong and patients life may be in danger. In the case of non-severe condition of a disease, if causes are not avoided and only treatment is given, the symptoms may vanish and disease may appear to be suppressed, but still it is not cured completely. It may flair up with a mild cause or even may get transformed into another unhealthy state. Here the flow of causes is not obstructed and is continuously attacking the body. This develops deterioration in the resisting power of the body. Again, one point should be noted here, that if causes are not avoided, the body does not give proper and expected response to the treatment. This prolongs the time for treatment and simultaneously drugs of higher potency only become useful. It is observed that sometimes, removal of cause is a life saving treatment as in the case of Aamas`hayagata visha Chhardan is the first choice of treatment here, which washes out Visha (poison) from Amaas`haya and avoids further complications. Many times non-avoidance of cause worsens the condition of patient e.g. Patient suffering from Parin`aamas`hoola if consumes spicy food, his symptoms certainly become severe. In some diseases occurrence of attack of a disease is dependent on the (consumption of cause or) contact with causative factor as in S`hvaasa or allergic disease; also in some psychological disorders like Unmaada etc. When these causes are avoided, the attacks generally do not appear. The knowledge of Hetu also inspires one to think for the proper and perfect line of treatment with consideration of various Dosha Vyaapara & Dooshya Vikriti.. Let us simplify this with an example. Amla, Lavan`a and Kat`u are the three Rasa, which increase Pitta Dosha. Here the treatment is Pitta S`hamana and Madhuraa, Tikta & Kashaaya are 3 Rasa useful for this. While choosing one Rasa, Vriddhi Avasthaa of Pitta Dosha should be examined thoroughly. Chakrapan`i clears this fact in his commentary (C.Vi 6/10) Lavan`a Rasa increases Pitta Dosha along with Kapha Dosha (with proportion (Pitta + & Kapha ++); Amla Rasa increases the same two Dosa but the proportion is different (Pitta ++ & Kapha +) and Kat`u Rasa increases Pitta along with Vata Dosha. i.e Amla Rasa increases Pitta ++ & Kapha + Lavan`a Rasa  increases Pitta + & Kapha + Kat`u Rasa increases Pitta & Vata The treatment differs accordingly as: If cause is Amla Rasa, then one should use Tikta Rasa because actions of these two Rasa are opposite to each other as: Amla Rasa  Opp  Tikta Rasa Properties Maamsa S`haithilyakara Maamsa Sthirikara Kapha Vilapaka  Kapha S`hoshaka Pitta vardhaka Pitta S`hoshaka The same direction can help a physician in choosing the correct drug. Let us consider the Hetu and Chikitsaa of Paan`d`uroga as mentioned in Charaka Samhitaa Mrid Bhaksan`ajanya: Paan`d`u is one type of Paan`d`uroga. Here consumption of clay is the main Hetu or etiological factor of the disease. This develops severe Raukshya in the body and very fine particles of soil remain unchanged / undigested (Avipakva) and get adhered to Srotas. This leads to Srotorodha. To treat this condition properly, eradication of fine soil particles from the body is essential for removal; the adhered particles should come in the flow of Dosha Visarpan`a. Virechana is the first S`hodhana treatment for Paan`d`uroga. Various Siddha Ghrita are advised in Paan`d`u for Snehana before Virechana. In case of Mrid Bhaksan`ajanya Paan`d`u the drugs of choice are Danti Ghrita : According to Anaagatavekshan`a Tantrayukti (Ch.Kalpasthana), Danti is Teekshn`a, Ushn`a, Vikaasee, Dosha-vilayankara (i.e. Kapha Pitta Vilayankara). This Ghrita will liquefy Kapha and Pitta. Also it will detach the adhered fine particles from Srotas and draw them in the flow. Thus, removal will be easy. Danti-Gomootra Virechana: After Snehana with Danti Ghrita, Virechana can be done with Danti + Gomootra with the same mode of action. With such type of total eradication of soil particles, further treatment of Paan`d`u will be effective and required time will not be prolonged. From this discussion, it can be inferred that: Thorough knowledge of Hetu leads towards perfection of treatment Thorough knowledge of Hetu is very much important to follow avoidance of causes which Stop further growth of disease Decrease severity of symptoms Protect further loss of strength of body Stop recurrence of attacks Itself can be a treatment Dr. Mrs. Y.

When Lord Shiva realized the evasion of duty by Daksha and became angry, from this third eye wrathful fire emanated, which burnt all the Asuraas. From this fire, Veerabhadra emerged out and destroyed Yadnya of Daksha Prajaapati. Later Veerabhadra became Jvara. As a result of this, the world got afflicted with burning sensation and pain. Also all the living creatures in different directions became unconscious. Gods, Rishi offered prayers Lord Shiva and pacified him. Thus Jvara is disease due to erratic regimens. Nirukti: Jvarayati S`hareeraan`i Iti Jvarah | C.Ni.1/35 Disease accompanying with fever, burning is Jvara. Introduction: Jvara is not only sign - fever, but a disorder affecting body, senses, and mind. It diminishes the intelligence, strength, complexion, joyfulness and enthusiasm of the sufferer and produces exhaustion, exertion, unconsciousness, and aversion to food also can lead even to death. Hyperpyrexia or fever (Santaapa) is characterized sign of Jvara. Synonyms: Jvara is also denoted by the names Antaka (kills a person) Vikaara Roga Vyaadhi Ojos`hana (deplete Ojas) Rogapati (King of the diseases) Kshaya  (emaciates body) Tama  (causes Moha - darkness or delusion of mind) Paapmaa  (result of wrong behavior or thought) Mrityu (cause of death) Yamaatmaka (like Yama - god of death)  Pravritti: Pravritti is Origin of Jvara (Prathama Aavirbhaava) due to acquisition (Parigraha). Jvara is originated because of the ferocious wrath of Rudra. Svabhaava: The responsible factors for manifestation of Jvara are S`haareera Dosha; Vaata, Pitta, Kapha and two Maanasa Dosha; Rajas and Manas. Clinical presentation: It is invariable manifestation of Jvara Santaapa (raised temperature) is characteristic sign of Jvara. Angamarda (malaise) Loss of perspiration (Sveda Avarodha) Body pain / limb seizure / spasm (Sarva Anga Graha) Aruchi (tastelessness of mouth) Trishn`aa (morbid thirst) Hrid Vyathaa (pain in cardiac region) When all these symptoms are present in a person at one time, the condition is named as Jvara. Adhishthaana: Site of manifestation of Jvara S`hareera (body) and Manas (Mind). Types: There are 8 causes of Jvara. Due to 8 reasons Jvara gets manifested. Nija Jvara: Vaataja Pittaja Kaphaja Vaata Pittaja Vaata Kaphaja Pitta Kaphaja Sannipaatika (13 types) Aagantu Jvara Other types according to various factors: Saamaanya Sampraapti:- Three aggravated Dosha, either individually or jointly in the combinations of two or three spread through Rasa Dhaatu. These Dosha dislodges the Jaat`haraagni from its own place. With their own heat and the heat of Jaat`haraagni, the heat pervades the entire body. The channels of circulation get obstructed by Saama Dosha and they being further aggravated pervade the entire body to produce excessive heat. Therefore the persons temperature increases all over the body and this condition is called as Jvara. Vaataja Jvara Sampraapti: Vaata gets aggravated due to the over indulgence in Vaata aggravating causative factors (Ruksha Gun`a, Chala Gun`a) This aggravated Vaata afflicts Aamaas`haya. Vaata gets mixed up with Agni. Collectively both aggravated Vaata and Agni, follow the course of first Dhaatu Rasa. They obstruct the Svedavaha and Rasavaha Srotas. Suppresses the activity of Agni and compel the Agni (Ushmaa  Paachakavahni) from the site of digestion (Paktisthaana - Paachakaagnisthaana). This Agni spreads all over the body and Vaataja Jvara gets manifested with Vaataja signs and symptoms. Pittaja Jvara Sampraapti: Pitta gets aggravated due to the over indulgence in Pitta aggravating causative factors (Drava, Ushn`a Gun`a) This aggravated Pitta afflicts Aamaas`haya and impels the Agni (Ushmaa  Paachakavahn) This Agni follows the course of first Dhaatu Rasa. They obstruct the Svedavaha and Rasavaha Srotas. Suppress the activity of Agni due to the liquidity of Pitta (Drava Gun`a) also compel Agni (Ushmaa  Paachakavahni) from the site of digestion (Paktisthaana - Paachakaagnisthaana) and spread all over the body manifesting Pittaja Jvara. Kaphaja Jvara Sampraapti: Kapha gets aggravated by the excessive intake of Kapha aggravating factors. (S`heeta Gun`a etc). Aggravated Kapha enters Aamaas`haya and gets mixed up with Agni. Collectively, Kapha and Agni, follow the course of Rasa and obstruct Rasavaha and Svedavaha Srotas. Suppresses the activity of Agni and compels Ushmaa (Agni) from the site of digestion. It spreads all over the body manifesting Kaphaja Jvara. Dvandvaja Jvara:- Dvandvaja Jvara are: Vaatapittaja Pittashleshmaja Vaatashleshmaja These Dvandvaja Jvara manifest with the combination of the symptoms of Vaataja Jvara, Kaphaja Jvara, Pittaja Jvara. Excessive consumption of causative factors leads to aggravation of Dosha. With the combinations of causative factors, two Dosha or all the three Dosha get vitiated. According to this vitiation, Dvandvaja or Saannipaatika Jvara manifest. Saannipaatika Jvara: Though in Sannipaata, all three Dosha are vitiated, according to quantitative vitiation and their combinations,13 types of Sannipaata are explained as follows: \u2014\u2014\u2014 - Ulban`a (Severely Vitiated Dosha) \u2014\u2014 - Madhya (Moderately Vitiated Dosha) \u2014 - Heena (Mildly Vitiated Dosha) Types of Sannipaata Jvara: Sannipaata is called as Abhinyaasa Jvara or Hataujas Jvara. According to Hemaadri, Sannipaata is predominated by Vaayu Abhinyaasa Sannipaata Jvara  if the patient sleeps excessively in Sannipaata Jvara. Abhinyaasa is predominated by Kapha Hataujasa Sannipaata Jvara  if the patient is emaciated. Hritaujasa is predominated by Pitta Hritaujasa Sannipaata Jvara  a Jvara which takes out the Ojas Sannyaasa Sannipaata Jvara  if the limbs are immovable. (Sannyasta Gaatra) Daahaadi Sannipaata Jvara  When patient feels burning sensation first at the onset of Jvara. S`heetaadi Sannipaata Jvara  When patient feels cold sensation first at the onset of Jvara. Other types: When burning sensation is first in Sannipaata, then it is difficult to cure than in Sannipaata where cold sensation. When Aahaara Rasa becomes partly digested or when Pitta and Kapha are vitiated then half of the body turns cold and half remain hot. It resembles to Narasimha (man-lion) or S`hiva. (Ardhanaarinat`es`hvara- half man and half woman) When vitiated Pitta remains in the body and Kapha in hands and feet, then it produces hotness in the body except hands and feet, whereas hands and feet remain cool. When vitiated Pitta remains in the hands and feet and Kapha in the body, then it produces hotness in the hands and feet except the body which remain cool. The symptoms are observed in the Jvara caused by Vaayu, Pitta and Kapha should also be known in those located in Dhaatu. When symptoms of all Dosha are found in fever located in Dhaatu it should be diagnosed as caused by Sannipaata. Similarly, that produced by two Dosha combined should be known by the synonyms of the respective Dosha. Aagantu Jvara: This Jvara is caused due to some exogenous factor. It is preceded with pain (Vyathaa). It remains exclusively exogenous for sometime and afterwards becomes associated with Dosha. Then the symptoms due to Dosha get manifested. In Aagantu Jvara, these symptoms due to association of Dosha appear after 7 days. This is the eighth type of Jvara. Aagantu (exogenous) Jvara can be caused due to following factors: Trauma (Abhighaata) Propensity or inclination or the state of being possessed by evil spirits (Abhishanga) Exorcising or incantation or employment of spells for a malevolent purpose (Abhichaara) Charge, accusation by the harmed or Rishi, Elderly (Abhishaapa) The Jvara caused by external factors are in the beginning independent. Subsequently, they get mixed up with the signs and symptoms of Nija (endogenous) types of Jvara. Then also, Aagantu Jvaraas have their own specific causative factors and treatment. Due to manifestation of disease, inflammation (Vidaaha), and Trauma; another type of Jvara appears by the same or different causative factors, however, it does not transcend the symptoms of Dosha. This is caused by an assault / trauma and associated mainly with Vaata. It resides in the vitiated blood (Dusht`a S`hon`ita) and symptoms are pain, Oedema. This is caused by evil spirits. (Bhootaabhishangaja) and associated with vitiated Vaata and Pitta on the physical level. Vaayu aggravates due to ungratified Kaama, Shoka, Bhaya; Pitta aggravates due to Krodha; all the three Dosha aggravate due to Bhootaabhishanga, so Abhishangaja Jvara is associated with Tridosha. Chakrapaan`i conjuncts that Kaamaabhishanga Jvara, a type of Abhishanga Jvara, is associated with Vaata and Pitta. It is manifested in resemblance with the symptoms of Unmaada. The symptoms which are seen in Unmaada, (eight types of Unmaada due to taking possession by (Aavesha) Deva, Pishaaccha etc.); also appear in this Abhishangaja Jvara (Bhoota Jvara) There is sudden laughing or crying seen in person who is attacked by Graha. Abhishangaja Jvara may occur due to contact with poisonous air of the toxic plants and such other toxins. It is cured by specific antidotes. Abhichaara is evil Taantrika rituals. It is frightful. (Ghora / Suduhsaha) This is Sannipaata Jvara. Due to the evil rituals in Atharva Veda, affected person manifests the symptoms of Manas Taapa. (Poorvam Chetah Tapyate |) Abhishaapa is charge or accusation of Siddha (who have attained spiritual perfection who are expert). It is caused by all the three Dosha (Sannipaata) This Jvara is intolerable (Ghora / Suduhsaha) and highly frightful. Praakrita Jvara: Jvara manifested in spring (Vasant Ritu) and autumn (Sharad Ritu) is curable (Saadhya) Depending upon the nature of the season, Praakrita Jvara is described. Generally Jvara caused by Vaayu is difficult to cure.  Praakrita Jvara in Sharad Ritu: Pitta which is hot in nature, in autumn (S`harad Ritu) aggravates due to hot causative factors. Kapha gets aggravated in winter (Hemanta and S`hishira Ritu), and gets precipitated (Prakopa) during spring season. During rainy season, the water and herbs become sour (Amla) in Vipaaka (post digestion taste) This results in accumulation of Pitta in rainy season. This accumulated Pitta gets precipitated (Prakopa) in autumn (S`harad Ritu) because of the sunlight. This immediately produces Jvara. The associated Dosha (Anubala) is Kapha. Praakrita Jvara in Vasanta Ritu: During first part of winter (Hemanta), the water and herbs become sweet in taste and are cold. This helps in the accumulation of Kapha. (Chaya) This Kapha gets liquefied (Prakopa) in the subsequent spring (Vasanta Ritu) because of the strong sunrays. The secondary associated Dosha are Vaayu and Pitta. Vaikrita Jvara: Vaatika Jvara irrespective of its season of occurrence. Paittika Jvara if it is occurring during the seasons other than autumn (S`harad Ritu) Kaphaja Jvara if it is occurring during the season other than spring (Vasanta Ritu) Dosha Praadhaanya of Praakrita / Vaikrita Jvara In Praakrita Jvara, fasting can not cause any trouble to the patient as it is a nature of Praakrita Jvara. Moreover, Varshaa and S`harad Ritu contribute to Visarga Kaala so there is no harm in fasting. In Vasanta Ritu, as Kapha plays a major role in manifesting Jvara, there is no harm in fasting. Vishama Jvara All these types of Jvara are referred as Vishama Jvara because Jvara manifests unequally, irregularly, dissimilarly, differently or inconstantly. It is called as Vishama Jvara as its onset is irregular, its symptoms and time are irregular and treatment is also irregular. Irregular onset  it may start form head or back or calf region. Irregular symptoms  it may give burning or cooling sensation. Irregular time  it may occur in the morning, afternoon etc. Irregular treatment  it may be cured by Brinhan`a or Langhana etc. In Vishama Jvara, generally there is association of Aagantu Jvara. Santata, Satata, Anyedyuh, Triteeyaka, Chaaturthaka are mostly caused by Sannipaata Doshagati and manifestation of Jvara When the channels of Rasa are affected by vitiated Dosha, the spread is all over the body as it is the most proximal of all Dhaatu. As the obstruction becomes distal  Rakta, Maamsa etc. the Dosha take longer to reach and thus longer time to manifest. In case of Rakta affection the fever surfaces twice in a day and night, while in case of Maamsa it occurs once a day. In case of Meda affection the fever occurs a day (alternate day). In case of Asthi and Majja affection, fever occurs after every two days (every fourth day)The more distally situated Dosha are the weaker they on e hence owing to the distal situation, they take equally longer time to reach the Aamaas`haya to produce fever. Some scholars say that Vishama Jvara is caused by invasion of evil spirits (Bhoota Abhishanga) Manifestation of Jvara in a particular time or the change of its time of occurrence takes place because of the following factors: Strength or weakness of Ritu (Season), Aha (Day), Raatra (Night), Dosha, Manas (Mind), Kaala and Artha (Karma)  sensory inputs. Some of the examples are highlighted below. Satata Jvara dominated by Vaayu and occurring in the rainy season (Varshaa) becomes Anyedyushka Jvara in autumn (S`harad) as a result of the latter season, which counteracts the aggravation of Vaayu. Chaturthaka Jvara dominated by the Vaata Dosha and occurring in the mid day or mid night of spring (Vasanta) may turn to Triteeyaka Jvara during afternoon or after mid night if patient consumes dry things (Rooksha). Because of the mental strength of the patient, the Satata Jvara may change to Anyedyushka Jvara. Otherwise, Chaturthaka Jvara may change to Triteeyaka Jvara, if there is mental weakness. Because of various acts in this life or the maturity of the result of actions in the past life, the patient becomes free from the miseries of Jvara and gets happiness. Sinful acts lead to more miseries. Vishama Jvara Sampraapti: A lean person, when cured from Jvara, indulges in faulty diet and activities, Dosha even if in small quantity aggravate. These Dosha are excited by Vaayu. Thus produce Satata, Anyedyushka, Triteeyaka, Chaturthaka, Pralepaka Jvara according to division of the sites of Kapha in successive order. Santata Jvara Sampraapti: Aggravated and stagnant Dosha due to heaviness, Saama Dosha spread all over the body through the channels carrying Rasa etc. Dhaatu, (especially Rasa Dhaatu Srotas) causing Jvara called as Santata Jvara. This Jvara is very acute (S`heeghrakaaree) in onset. Either it gets cured or kills the patient on 7 th , 10 th or 12 th day. It is extremely difficult to endure. (Suduhsaha). It cannot be perverted (Nishpratyaneeka), therefore, it is known to be unbearable. This is caused due to all the three Dosha. But it manifests according to the dominance of Dosha in respect to the Kaala. (Dosha Kaala Bala Abala) In Santata Jvara, Dosha involved in manifestation of Santata Jvara, is similar in attributes of season (Kaala), Dhaatu (Dooshya), physical constitution (Prakriti). In this type 12 factors, viz. 7 Dhaatu, 2 Mala (Mootra, Pureesha), 3 Dosha are also simultaneously involved in this Jvara inevitably. Chakrapaan`i has opined that Santata Jvara is not a type of Vishama Jvara, as it does not show irregularity. It remains continuously. Relation of Dosha and duration is specified by Agnives`ha Depending on the cleanness and uncleanness of Dhaatu, Haatira says that either Santata Jvara gets cured or kills the patient by 14 or 18 or 22 days respectively for Vaata, Pitta and Kapha predominant Jvara. Satata Jvara Sampraapti: When channels of Rakta Dhaatu are obstructed and distal then Dosha spread over the body comparatively in longer time, it is Satata Jvara. Dosha are located in Rakta Dhaatu generally. Satata Jvara occurs twice in a day and night. It gets aggravated and subsided depending upon the nature of time. When a time is favorable for Dosha, Jvara manifests. In adverse condition of Dosha, Jvara subsides. Anyedyushka Jvara Sampraapti: When Dosha traverse from chest to stomach in a day and night, next day they produce Anyedyushka Jvara. When these Dosha spread in the channel of Maamsa which has its openings obstructed and they are further longer. In the day and night, it occurs only once. Anyedyushka Viparyaya: When Dosha are situated in chest and stomach, they produce Jvara opposite to Anyedyushka. This Jvara continuous for whole day and night with remission only once in forenoon. Triteeyaka Jvara Sampraapti: When Dosha traverse from throat (Kan`t`ha) to stomach in two days and night, on the third day they produce Triteeyaka Jvara. The channel of Meda is more distal to Maamsa, so the Dosha reach there relatively in more time and Jvara occurs after one day (at the third day from the previous paroxysm), this is Triteeyaka Jvara. It has following subtypes: Triteeyaka Viparyaya: When Dosha are situated in throat, chest and stomach they produce Jvara opposite to Triteeyaka Jvara which has remission on third day. It remains for first two days. Chaturthaka Jvara Sampraapti: When Dosha traverse from head (S`hira) to stomach on the fourth day they produce Chaturthaka Jvara. The channels for Asthi are more distal so the Jvara occurs after every two days, this is Chaturthaka Jvara. It has following subtypes: Chaturthaka Viparyaya: When Dosha are situated in head, throat, chest and stomach, they produce a Jvara opposite to Chaturthaka Jvara which has remission of fourth day. It remains for three days. Chaturthaka Viparyaya occurs on second and third day and pacifies on fourth day. When Dosha afflicts Asthi and Majja, Jvara produced is Chaturthaka Viparyaya. It is again of three types; either Vaataja or Pittaja or Kaphaja. This Jvara subsides on fourth day and continues to be for two days. Pralepaka Jvara: When Dosha are situated in joints (Sandhi) they produce Jvara, which is continual. This Jvara is seen in Raajayakshmaa only. Some Other Types of Jvara:- Kaamaja Jvara Shokaja Jvara Bhayaja Jvara Krodhaja Jvara Vishaja Jvara Aushadhee Gandhaja Jvara In some of these Jvara, fever appears first and then the signs and symptoms of Kaama (Passion) etc. are manifested, and in others it happens the other way. The specific features of Kaama etc., described in the context of Jvara get manifested also in other diseases like Unmaada etc., caused by these factors. In Kaamaja Jvara etc., the mind is first afflicted by passion etc., but the Jvara does not gain strength till such time as the Dosha of the body are vitiated. Similarly, vitiation of Dosha in the body does not gain power for the production of Jvara till such time as the mind is not afflicted by Kaama etc. Punaraavartaka Jvara (Recurring fever):- Patient suffering from fever should follow strict Pathyaapathya. This should be continued though he becomes free from fever. Diet and other factors, which trigger Dosha Vriddhi, Jvara reappears. This is called as Punaraavartaka Jvara. Jeern`a Jvara: After 3 weeks Jvara can be called as Jeern`a Jvara. Dhaatu become weak and this condition is usually presented with Raukshya, Pleehaa Vriddhi and Agnimaandya. Diagnosis of Jvara: Specific diagnosis of Jvara should be confirmed for further treatment decisions. Type of pathology, involved Dosha, Avasthaa, etc are important factors to decide treatment.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4aee54af-5d2d-4634-9cc5-8a42416f1daa": {"__data__": {"id_": "4aee54af-5d2d-4634-9cc5-8a42416f1daa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"tag": "p", "file_path": "/home/dai/rag/data/clean_html/Articles/Nidaana/Kaamalaa.htm", "file_name": "Kaamalaa.htm", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 3982, "creation_date": "2024-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-14", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-15", "summary": "Kaamalaa, also known as jaundice, is a condition that arises due to an excess of Pitta in the body.

It may also occur without manifestation of Paan`d`u Roga in a person who is having Pitta dominance. Sclera, nails, skin and face turn to the colour of turmeric (Haridraa). The stools and urine change to reddish yellow colour. The skin complexion resembles to the skin of frog. The perceptive ability of the sense organs gets diminished with symptoms like Daaha (burning sensation), Avipaaka (indigestion), Daurbalya (debility), and Aruchi (anorexia). It is generally said that S`haakhaas`hrita Bahupittaa Kaamalaa is manifested after Kaamalaa while S`haakhaas`hrita Alpapittaa Kaamalaa manifests without prerequisite of Kaamalaa. Sampraapti: Paan`d`u Rogee (a person suffering from Paan`d`u), indulges in Pitta aggravating factors such as sour food, alcohol, unwholesome diet. This aggravates Pitta and causes destruction of Rakta and Maamsa Dhaatu. Due to this Kaamalaa manifests.

There is oedema all over the body with redness in the eyes, face. Blood passes through the stools, urine and vomiting. The colour of stools and urine turns to blackish yellow. A patient feels as if he is entering into the darkness. Digestive capacity is totally lost. There is pricking pain in the interphalengeal joints (Parva Bheda). At the end patient dies. This is termed as Kumbha Kaamalaa. It is very difficult to cure.

Kaasa is disease which is manifested with the      forceful coughing (it indicates speed i.e. Gati of Vaayu)      and the depletion of the Dhaatu and Ura. Kaasa manifests      with a specific sound and pain. Vaayu moves out through the      mouth due to the Aavaran`a by Kapha etc. with      speed making a sound like broken vessel of bronze.  Prognosis of the disease is RaajaYakshmaa      (Kshaya); if any type of Kaasa remains untreated.  Types: Vaataja Pittaja Kaphaja Kshatja Kshayaja (DhaatuKshayaja)  Sampraapti: Due to the      causative factors, Apaana Vaayu gets obstructed. Obstructed Vaayu,      instead of downward direction, moves upwards. Praan`a      Vaayu gets      associated with Udaana. This Vaayu      gets choked up in the throat and chest. It also moves in channels of      head. There is breaking and jerky pain at the time of paroxysm with      twisting pain in mandible, neck, eyes, back, chest and sides of      chest. This Vaayu      makes the sound with or without Kaasa. This vitiated Praan`a      Vaayu gets expelled out Udaana through mouth suddenly. It comes out      suddenly with the Dosha through the mouth making sound like a      broken vessel of bronze. It is Kaasa.  Clinical presentation of Kaasa types: Vaataja Kaasa: There is dry cough. Patient      gets relief after releasing the Kapha. But the Kapha releases      very difficultly. It subsides after having food of Snigdha, Amla, Lavan`a      and Ushn`a attributes. The paroxysm of the cough      increases after the digestion of the food. The speed of the Kaasa      is very high (Mahaa / Prasakta Vega)  Pittaja Kaasa: In Pittaja Kaasa there      is continuous coughing. There is spitting of Kapha which is      associated with Pitta.  Kaphaja Kaasa: There is obstruction in the      passage of Vaayu by aggravated Kapha. There is spitting      of thick, sweet, unctuous Kapha.  Kshataja Kaasa: Due to excessive exercises,      battles, etc. person, in whom dryness is increased; the aggravated Vaayu      harbours in the wound formed in the chest. In this condition      patient coughs first and them there is spitting of blood. There is      pricking pain in the chest. There is gurgling sound like pigeon.      Actually, this symptomatic picture is seen also in Saahasaja Raajayakshmaa.  Gradually strength, digestion      capacity, complexion gets decreased. This lead to the UrahKshata, KshataKsheen`a,      and Raajayakshmaa which are manifested with Kaasa.  Difference between UrahKshata      and Kshataja Kaasa: In UrahKshata patient      spits Kapha with Rakta but in Kshataja Kaasa      there is dry coughing first and then patient spits Rakta.  Kshayaja Kaasa: Emaciation due to Raajayakshmaa,      old age and depletion of Dhaatu lead to Kaasa. All the      three Dosha get aggravated. Agni (digestive capacity)      is hampered and unable to digest food. There is spitting of putrid,      greenish, bloody, suppurated Kapha. It manifests with symptoms      of Jvara.  Kshayaja Kaasa      which may lead to death in emaciated patients. All the symptoms of Kshaya      are manifested in this Kaasa. If not treated, it leads to S`hvaasa,      Kshaya, Chhardi, Svarasaada. Therefore, it is necessary to treat Kaasa      immediately.

Dhvajabhangakrita Klaibya: It means the shattering of the penis due to several causative factors. It leads to the erectile dysfunction of the penis which is the cause of the Klaibya. It is Asaadhya. Jaraaja Klaibya: This Klaibya is caused due to the age factor. In the old age, where all the Dhaatu has gone depleted. Moreover, there is depletion of S`hukra Dhaatu. Also, a person if does not consume any Vrishya Aahaara, then there can not be nourishment of S`hukra Dhaatu. It leads to the Kshaya of Bala, Veerya, and Indriya. A person is highly depleted and becomes weak, lustreless (Vivarn`atva) and Deena. He may lead to the many diseases and could have Dhaatu Kshaya, S`hukra Kshaya and Vaata Prakopa. Kshayaja Klaibya: The first Dhaatu i.e. Rasa gets depleted due to the causative factors. Ultimately it leads to the depletion of the next Rakta and other Dhaatu. In this condition, if any person indulges in to the sexual act, then there is more loss of S`hukra. This is a serious condition which leads to the death. It is Asaadhya. Beejadoshaja Klaibya: Due to the Beejadosha, Doshaa in the Garbha enter in to the Retovaha siraa. They dry out the Retas. Therefore, though a foetus is well developed, it is devoid of the male sexual characters. It is Asaadhya. It is caused due to Sannipaata. Maanasa Klaibya: Due to unpleasant factors and some untruthful acts by a female, there is a Klaibya which is Maanasa. DhaatuKshayaja Klaibya / Aahaaraja: This is caused due to the depletion of the S`hukra Dhaatu. Dhvajabhangaja Klaibya / Dhaatukshayaja: This is caused due to the excessive sexual act and not having any Vaajeekaran`a Dravya. This is Dhvajopaghaataja Klaibya. It is caused due to the excessive Dhaatu Kshaya. Pumstvopaghaataja Klaibya / Marmaaghaataja: This is caused due to the Med`hra Roga or trauma on to the Marma. This is Pumstvopaghaataja Klaibya.

Svaroopa: Kshataksheen`a is caused due to Urah Kshata. Urah Kshata is a prerequisite for a disease Kshataksheen`a. If any injury happens in the chest, then a person lands in to a disease Urah Kshata. Urah Kshata is then converted in to the Kshataksheen`a. Kshataksheen`a is a status of disease in which patient has emaciated due to the wound in the chest. So it is sure that Urah Kshata is a prerequisite for Kshataksheen`a. One may get confuse Kshataksheen`a with Raajayakshmaa; but it is different from Raajayakshmaa as the Sampraapti of them is totally different. It has been clearly said that Raajayakshmaa is Anubandha (uninterrupted succession of Urah Kshata) if at all it remains untreated.

Because of the above mentioned factors, the chest gets broken, punctured and cracked. Sides of the chest get pressed. There are tremors in the limb and the patient gets emaciated. Gradually, the Veerya (potency), Bala (strength), Varn`a (complexion), Ruchi (appetite) and Agni (digestive capacity) get reduced. The patient suffers from Jvara (fever), Vyathaa (pain or any disease), Mano Dainya (mental depression) and Atisaara (diarrhoea) even though there is no Agnimaandya.

This can occur due to excessive elimination, pacifying treatments, suppressing urges, improper diet, mental distress, excessive exertion, fasting, or excessive sexual indulgence.\n\nRecognizing Ksheena Dosha is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Signs and symptoms vary depending on the affected Dosha. For example, Ksheena Vata Dosha can manifest as slow movement, reduced speech, lack of enthusiasm, and confusion. Ksheena Pitta Dosha may present as low body temperature, weak digestion, and pale complexion. Ksheena Kapha Dosha can cause dryness, internal burning, and a feeling of emptiness in the stomach and other organs.\n\nTreatment for Ksheena Dosha involves increasing the levels of the affected Dosha. This can be achieved through measures that possess specific qualities or actions known as Gunas and Karmas. For instance, to increase Vata Dosha, warm, dry, and pungent substances can be used. Pitta Dosha can be increased using hot, bitter, and astringent substances, while Kapha Dosha can be increased using oily, cold, and sweet substances.\n\nIgnoring Ksheena Dosha can lead to misdiagnosis and inadequate treatment, resulting in prolonged suffering.

In the understanding of the shift there is emphasis on increase in Dosha-qualities, and the consequent functions of Dosha_s are inflicted on the tissues. The shift by decrease is possible, to initiate certain ill health problems. To catch the attention of the professionals, to this happening, the contribution of Ksheen`a Dosha is useful. Major elaborations in texts and commentaries; deal with situations where provocation results in a variety of signs and symptoms of disease, the all out line of management is by choosing enthusiastically, means against the seen attributes of Dosha_s. But providing Dosha provocation factors, as the main components of treatment, Ksheen`a Dosha is required in management of the decreased levels. This distinction is likely to be missed, if the professional is not timely prompt and keen to imagine this. The success of a capable physician is more enhanced by paying attention to ascertainment about less Dosha status, and appropriate (usually missed) provocation providing treatment for it. It is relatively less in actual incidence, when properly attended; it adds additional credit to relief from pain, suffering, of the clientele. In the following article the transliterated Ayurvedic terms are accompanied by suitable English words, whereby the purpose of communication is served. The Ayurvedic classics have emphasized the important role of the three Dosha_s in the causation of both: Svaasthya i.e. Health & Vyaadhi i.e. Disease (A.H.Su. 1/18) This dual causative role is dependent on the Saamya i.e. Relative balance of the Three Dosha_s vis-a-vis each other. This status or level of three Dosha-Saamya i.e. Relative balance amongst the three Dosha_s is individual specific from birth and termed Deha-Prakruti. (C.Vi. 8/95) This three Dosha level defined at birth, in a healthy individual, is the basic reference scale for that individual and is essentially unchangeable. Whilst in health, the classics have noted that there can be some transient change, in the levels, due to diet, effect of seasons, day and night as well as age, but by and large a good health is maintained. The three Dosha_s possess suitable group of Gun`a_s (properties / attributes) and Karma_s (actions). (C.Su.1/50) when in balance. (A.H. Su.1/14-16 & 11/1-2, C.Vi8/96-98) Since the absolute levels of each of the Dosha_s cannot be defined as: There is variation in individual physiology and There are variations taking place in dynamism for homeostasis, attributable to the factor of time or ageing. (S. Su. 15/43) it is not reasonable to fix absolute measurements of body components. Hence, the levels of Dosha_s are to be deduced based on the presence or absence of normal Karma_s. Excessive expression or inhibition of Karma_s is indicative of relative Vriddhi (increase) or Ksheen`ataa (decrease) of Dosha_s. (A.H.Su.11/32, 5-7, 18-20) By following, the Ksheen`a Dosha status the following features are to be cognized: Ati S`hodhana, excessive elimination Ati-Sams`hamana, excessive pacifying treatment Vega-Vidhaarana suppressing urges, worth attending to Asaatmya-Anna, food that is not suitable Manastaapa, upsetting of mind Vyaayaama, inappropriate exertion Anas`hana, fasting, when not indicated Ati-Maithuna (S.Su. 15/11) excessive sex indulgence. The various classics have noted the Lakshan`a_s (signs and symptoms) of Ksheen`a Dosha as follows: Ksheen`a Vaata Dosha Manda-Chesht`ataa Alpa Vaktva Apraharsha Mood`ha-Sandnyataa II.  Ksheen`a Pitta Dosha Manda-Ushma Manda-Agni Nishprabhatva Ksheen`a Kapha Dosha Rukshataa Antardaaha Amaas`haya Shoonyataa Itar (S`hleshmas`haya) Shoonyataa Sandhi S`haithilya Trushn`aa Daurbalya Prajagaran`a Ksheen`a Vaata Dosha Praseka Aruchi Hrullaasa Ksheen`a Pitta Dosha Stambha S`haitya Aniyata Toda Aniyata Daaha Aniyata Arochaka Ksheen`a S`leshma Dosha Bhrama Udvesht`ana Anidraa Angamarda Paris`hosha B.

Ksheen`a Pitta Dosha Manda Anala S`heeta Prabhaahaani III. Ksheen`a S`leshma Dosha Bhrama S`hleshmaashaya Shoonyatva Hriddrava S`hlathasandhitaa According to Charaka (C .Su. 17/32) According to Charaka; Ksheen`a Dosha_s cease to manifest their natural actions. Besides the above person having Ksheen`a Dosha exhibits certain desires. These are elaborated in detail by various classical authors. These can also help a Vaidya to diagnose and treat the condition of Ksheen`a Dosha. D`alhan`a in his commentary on the discussion regarding Ksheen`a Dosha in Sushrut, refers to an unidentified quotation which enlists, the types of food attributes desired in such conditions. Sarvaangasundara on AH.Su.11/44 also opines, that such likings or cravings are exhibited by patients affected with Ksheen`a Dosha. In Ksheena Vaata Dosha, the following desire are observed; S`heeta & Ruksha Guna and Kat`u Rasa predominant foods, In Ksheena Pitta Dosha desire is for; Ushn`a Gun`a and Kat`u Rasa predominant foods, In Ksheena Kapha Dosha desire is for: Snigdha and S`heeta Gun`a predominant foods Consideration of Ksheen`a Dosha in the causation of disease Charaka has described Ksheen`a as one of the 3 Gati_s of the Dosha_s. Here Chakrapaan`i has commented that the word Gati implies the meaning of both Prakaara (type) and Avasthaa (stage/condition). According to the commentator Chakrapaan`i (on C.Su. 17/32) Ksheen`a Dosha cannot cause an independent disease because of the inability of the Ksheen`a to migrate from one place to another and vitiate the Dushya_s. According to Padaartha Chandrikaa commentary on Asht`aanga Hridaya (on A.H.Su. 11/45) Ksheen`a Dosha cannot cause disease because they are: Aprakupita (non-aggravated/ not in excess) Ksheen`a S`hakti (low strength/low potential) Kinchit Karatva (poor kinetic ability) Importance of Diagnosis of Ksheen`a Dosha: The classics have noted that Ksheen`a Dosha should not be ignore but must be given due attention to, while making a diagnosis as well as during treatment as they can be misdiagnosed and lead to immense suffering. (Commentaries of Sarvangasundar, Padaarthachandrikaa on A. H. Su. 11/44 and 46 and Hemaadri, Sarvaangasundara, commentaries on A.H.Su.11/33) Types of Ksheen`a Doshatva Though the classics have not classified it accordingly the commentators of the classics have done so Alpa, (mild) Madhya (moderate) Bhooya (severe) (Padaarthachandriakaa commentary on A.H.Su. 11/45) Gangaadhara, the commentator on Charaka has opined that there are 25 subtypes of Ksheen`a Dosha Avastha_s. However he has not enlisted the Symptomology of each of these subtypes. (Gangaadhara on Charaka. Su. 17/32) Treatment of Ksheen`a Dosha: The guiding principle laid down by Sus`hruta is that Sva-Yoni-Vardhana treatment is advised for Ksheen`a Dosha. Sva-Yoni-Vardhana literally translates as increasing ones own roots or origins. This is also interpreted variously. The commentator D`alhan`a has noted the following interpretations: (S.Su.15/11): Indicates usage of (Dosha specific) Gun`a_s of S`heeta, Ruksha etc., to increase the relevant Dosha All measures that increase the Dosha_s, (Charaka has laid down the Saamaanya-Vis`hesha Siddhaanta and the commentator Chakrapaan`i has discussed the usage of Gun`a Saamaanya, Dravya Saamaanya and Karma Saamaanya to increase any Dravya (here Dosha) (Chakrapaan`i on C.Su.1/44-45, The roots of Kapha and Pitta are Rasa + Rakta Dhaatu respectively so measures, which increases these, Dhaatu_s, will help increase the relevant Dosha. In terms of Paanchbhautikatva it would mean increase of Apya and Apya-Tejas substances.

This encompasses a wide range of conditions that affect the skin's appearance and texture. The underlying cause of Kusht`ha is an imbalance in the three bodily humors (Doshas): Vaata (air and space), Pitta (fire and water), and Kapha (earth and water). These Doshas, when vitiated, can affect the skin's natural glow and cause various symptoms depending on the specific Dosha involved. Ayurveda recognizes seven main types of Kusht`ha based on the dominant Dosha: Vaataja (caused by aggravated Vaata), Pittaja (caused by aggravated Pitta), Kaphaja (caused by aggravated Kapha), VaataPittaja (caused by aggravated Vaata and Pitta), VaataKaphaja (caused by aggravated Vaata and Kapha), PittaKaphaja (caused by aggravated Pitta and Kapha), and Saannipaatika (caused by aggravation of all three Doshas). Additionally, Ayurveda also categorizes Kusht`ha based on the affected body tissues (Dhatugata Kusht`ha), such as Tvakstha Kusht`ha (affecting the skin), Rakta Sams`hrita Kusht`ha (affecting the blood), and Maamsa Samaas`hrita Kusht`ha (affecting the muscles).

Hence, this term covers all skin disorders. Nirukti: Doshaah Dusht`aah Tvachah Vaivarn`yam Kurvanti,Tat Kusht`ham | A.H.Ni. 14/3 Yasmaat Sarvam Vapuh Kaalena Upekshitam Kushn`aati,Tat Kusht`ham | A.H.Ni. 14/4 Mythological Origin of Kusht`ha: During the destruction of Dakshaas sacrifice due to Havih Praas`hana, Prameha and Kusht`ha manifested itself after Gulma. Havih is the sacred offering meant for the deity and the Agni, if a person consumes it then his Jaat`haraagni is affected adversely and manifests as various diseases of low gastric fire activity (Mandaagni) Prameha being one of them. Svaroopa Kusht`ha means skin disorders; as Kusht`ha manifests on skin with various symptoms according to Dosha. Kusht`ha is a disease in which skin gets affected. Tvak is Spars`hanendriya. Hence, Kusht`ha is named upon any skin disorder which changes the natural luster and glow of skin. It gives tattered appearance to the skin. Sus`hruta has named Kusht`ha as Tvag Dosha. Dosha There are 7 factors involved in the disease Kusht`ha. Out of them the three are Dosha viz., Vaata, Pitta and Kapha. It is necessary that these Dosha should get vitiated first due to the causative factors of Kusht`ha. Unless and until the Dosha vitiate by causative factors of Kusht`ha, it does not manifest but if they vitiated from some other causative factors some other disease will be manifested like Visarpa. Dooshya Four Dooshya are: Tvak (skin) Maamsa (muscular tissue) Rakta Laseekaa (body fluid between skin and muscular tissue) / Ambu It means that in any type of Kusht`ha, Tvak (skin) is the factor which gets affected at the onset of disease. Then as time passes the other factors get affected. This affection of Maamsa, Rakta, Laseekaa and Tvak is general factor in all the types of Kusht`ha. Kusht`ha may affect other Dhaatu also with due course of time. Ultimately, Kusht`ha spreads all over the body. (Chakrapaan`i) Vitiation of all the three Dosha is a necessary factor in manifestation of Kusht`ha. No Kusht`ha manifests itself due to the aggravation of only one Dosha. Depending upon combinations of Dosha and Dooshya, depending upon the different types of pain, colour, shape, specific symptomatic manifestations (Prabhaava), name of the Kusht`ha and treatment of various types; though they are produced by same types of causative factors (Three Dosha, Tvak, Maamsa, Laseekaa and Rakta), number of types of Kusht`ha are possible. The types of Kusht`ha may be 7 or 18 or numerous (countless). Dosha bring various combinations in this disease related to Saadhya Vyaadhi only. For incurable type of Kusht`ha various types are not to be considered. As all the types of Kusht`ha are impossible to describe only seven types of Kusht`ha are explained in Charaka. Types of Kusht`ha: Though Kusht`ha is a disease due to all the three Dosha, its types are mentioned according to the dominance of the Dosha in a specific type, as explained in the table. Mahaa Kusht`ha:  Sampraapti: Due to the indulgence in causative factors all the three Dosha simultaneously aggravate. All the four Dooshya viz., Laseekaa, Maamsa, Rakta and Tvak become flaccid (S`haithila) Dosha harboring in the Dhaatu, affecting all the 4 Dooshya produce Kusht`ha. When Dosha get stability in the tissues then only they are capable to manifest Kusht`ha. Dosha which are moving in the tissues are not able to manifest Kusht`ha. Types: Kusht`ha is of 7 types according to the dominance of the Dosha. Vaataja Pittaja Kaphaja VaataPittaja VaataKaphaja PittaKaphaja Saannipaatika Dhaatugata Kusht`ha: Maadhava nidaana has given the types of Kusht`ha according to the Dhaatugatatva. Tvakstha Kusht`ha Rakta Sams`hrita Kusht`ha Maamsa Samaas`hrita Kusht`ha Meda Sthaanagata Kusht`ha Asthi Majja Samaas`hrita Kusht`ha S`hukta S`hin`itagata Kusht`ha Kusht`ha and Visarpa In Visarpa and Kusht`ha, the Dooshya are same which get vitiated due to the already vitiated Dosha. But the difference is that in Visarpa, all the Dooshya do not get affected, whereas in Kusht`ha invariably all the Dooshya get affected. In Visarpa Rakta Dusht`i is a major part hence there is acute pain. Asaadhyatva: Kaakan`ka Kusht`ha is incurable. Except Kaakan`aka Kusht`ha all the types of Kusht`ha may turn to incurable status due to negligence or wrong treatment. In the incurable types of Kusht`ha there may be the exudation due to Dosha (Abhishyanda). Also, in curable types of Kusht`ha due to negligence maggots may happen as effect of putrefaction of skin, muscular tissue, blood, and body fluid (Kleda). These maggots (Krimi) are the cause of complications in Kusht`ha. Mahaakusht`ha and Dosha dominance Kshudra Kusht`ha and Dosha dominance According to Sus`hruta, all the types of Kusht`ha are manifested due to Tridosha. Krimi is another factor which is also responsible for Kusht`ha according to Sus`hruta, but the type of Kusht`ha is named as per the dominance of the Dosha.

If any of the Madya (Suraa) should be prepared and consumed as per rules and regulations for its benefits and to avoid unwanted effects. Though there are different types of liquors mentioned in the text (Naama Vis`hesha), though they are prepared from different origins like leaves, roots etc. (Madya Yoni), though they are prepared with various processes (Samskaara), they all can be categorized as a single entity, as they produce Mada (hilarity) Mythological origin: Suraa (wine or spirituous liquor) was used for Havana in Sautraaman`i Yadnya which was carried out in honor of Indra. He fell down after consuming Suraa in excessive amount. He became devoid of Ojas, felt as if he was entering into the darkness (Tamasaa Aavisht`ah). Synonyms: Paanaatyaya Paanahata Nirukti: Mada Saamaanya Lakshan`aat Madah | C.Chi.24/6 Chakrapaan`i Mada Eva Aatyayiko Madaatyaya Iti Niruchyate | C.Chi.24/101-106 Jaayante Mohanidraantaa Madyasyaatinishevan`aat | Sa MadyaVibhramo Naamnaa Mada Iti Abhidheyate || C.Chi.24/40 Due to excessive consumption of Madya (alcohol), Moha and Nidraa are manifested. This is perversion in mental traits, so called as Mada. It is cardinal sign of consumption of any liquor. The disease manifested needs to be treated immediately without passing time, so it is called as Aatyayika (should be treated as emergency) Considering social effects, Madaatyaya is a cause of disgrace, bad character of a person. Effects of Madya: Suraa offers benefits and included as a formulation type. It has potent effects on body and mind. It is effective for S`hoka (sorrow), Arati (dulness), Bhaya (fear), Udvega (anxiety). It also causes Preeti (pleasure), Rati (the pleasure of love), Vaag (speech), Pusht`i (nourishment), Nirvritti (completion) in gods, Gandharva, Yaksha, Raakshasa and human beings. Madya Sevana Vidhi: Before having liquor, a person should bath and wear nice, clean clothes. He can apply scents etc. fragrances. He can become beautiful with garlands of flowers and precious stones etc. he should pray to god and chant Stotra. After spreading the flowers, burning Dhoopa etc., arranging pillows and bed for comfort, a person can sit or have any comfortable position. He should drink the liquor using the clean pots of gold, silver etc. He should consume fruits, meat with liquor. Madya and Ojas: Madya with its 10 attributes irritates all the 10 attributes of Ojas after entering into the Hridaya. It causes perversion in the functions of mind. (Cheto Vikraya) Madya after entering in Hridaya, irritates Sattva (mind) causing hilarity, exitement. It depletes all the attributes of Oja. Hridaya is a site of Rasa etc. Dhaatu, Sattva (Manas), Buddhi, Indriya, Aatman and Ojas. When Madya is consumed in excessive amount, the Ojas is destroyed. There is vitiation of Hridaya and the Dhaatu (Sattva, Buddhi, Indriya, Aatman etc. Chakrapaan`i) related to it. Types of Madaaatyaya: Prathama Mada Madhyama Mada Antya Mada Prathama (Poorva) Mada: When the Madya is consumed, Buddhi, Sattva, Indriya, Aatman etc get awakened and stimulated. This is stage of Prathama Mada. This Mada makes a person happy and gives pleasure. Madhyama (Dviteeya) Mada: Madya hampers the attributes of the Ojas relatively at high level; this is Madhyama Mada. In this state, there is mild perversion in Smriti, Moha, speech etc. A person cannot enjoy the immediate effective pleasure of the things (Taadaatvaka Sukha Na Anubhavati). Uttama (Triteeya / Antya / Pas`hchima) Mada: There is severe destruction of the attributes of Ojas in this stage. When person reaches in this state, there is nothing that cannot be done by Raajasa or Taamaasa person. He can act like an elephant that is not controlled and hilarious. This stage correlates with Unmaada. A person becomes helpless like a broken pillar. Though he is living, he is as much as dead whose mind is covered by Mada and Moha. He cannot get satisfaction or pleasure from the things for which he had Madya. He cannot differentiate between the dos and donts; happiness and pleasure, Hitaka anda Ahitakara. He becomes disgraced and refused by all others. He becomes passionate for the Madya (Vyasana). Ultimately, suffers from the disease Madaatyaya. In this stage person becomes calm like a dead. Madya is responsible for Smriti Vibhrams`ha, which is a cause of Pradnyaaparaadha and all the sinful and bad acts. Madya leads to the Moha, Bhaya, S`hoka, Krodha, Apasmaara, Unmaada, Mada, Moorchchhaa and death. If only Madya is consumed without food, it causes the difficultly curable diseases and the death. Madya consumed by a person who is angry, feared, thirsty, sorrowed, hungry, exercised, carried load on his head, walked a long distance, suppressing natural urges, eaten sour things in excess, having indigestion, unhealthy, got hot in the sunlight suffers with the diseases like Paanaatyaya, Paramada, Paanaajeern`a, Paanavibhrama. Actually, if Madya is consumed with the proper way it is good for health; otherwise it causes death. Conditions not prone to Madaatyaya: Madaatyaya is not manifested or mildly manifested in the persons who are strong, whose intake is high, who are unctuous, whose mental ability is high (Sattvayukta), who are young, who consume Madya regularly, persons having aggravated Medas and Kapha, in whom Vaata and Pitta are not dominant. Paisht`ika Madya is not opposite to the attributes of Ojas and Vikaas`hee, Rooksha and Vis`hada attributes are not too dominant; therefore it does not cause Mada Triteeya Mada is counted as Chaturtha Mada by Maadhava Nidaana and Triteeya Mada separately explained. Triteeya Mada - explained by Maadhava Nidaana : Actually, this state is explained by Charaka as the mediator phase of Dviteeya and Triteeya Mada. In this state, a person disgraces or dishonors the teachers (Guru), travels with the defected vehicles, he does the things which he doesnt do otherwise, eats uneatable things, loses his senses, talks out the secrets. The transitory phase between Dviteeya and Triteeya Mada is explained as Triteeya Mada by Sus`hruta; whereas Triteeya Mada explained by Charaka is Chaturtha Mada explained by Sus`hruta. Other Types: Actually, Madya causes vitiation of all the three Dosha. Considering the dominance of the symptoms Madaatyaya is denoted by that Dosha. It should be treated as per dominance of Dosha or manifestation of the symptoms. Vaataja Madaatyaya Pittaja Madaatyaya Kaphaja Madaatyaya Saannipaatika Maadaatyaya Dhvamsaka and Vikshaya: A person, who kept himself away from Madya for long days, consumes it suddenly and excessively; it leads to the diseases like Dhvamsaka and Vikshaya. They are very difficult to cure; especially in a person who is emaciated due to the disease. One who is averted from Madya, has control on his senses, remains always free from the somatic and psychic diseases.

Thus he explains Mootraaghaata like this: Vaataja Mootrakrichchhra Pittaja Mootrakrichchhra Kaphaja Mootrakrichchhra Saannipaatika Mootrakrichchhra Vaataja As`hmaree Pittaja As`hmaree Kaphaja As`hmaree S`hukraas`hmaree Vaatabasti Vaataasht`heelaa Vaatakun`d`alikaa Mootraateeta Mootrajat`hara Mootrotsanga Mootragranthi Mootras`hukra Vid`vighaata Ushn`avaata MootraKshaya Mootrasaada Mootrakrichchhra Types: Comparative Study Types according to Charaka Samhitaa Vaataja Pittaja Kaphaja Saannipaatika Mootraas`hmareeja Mootrakrichchhra Vaataja Mootraas`hmaree Pittaja Mootraas`hmaree Kaphaja Mootraas`hmaree S`hukraja Mootraas`hmaree (Retas) Abhighaataja Mootrakrichchhra S`hukraja Mootrakrichchhra Kshataja / Kshayaja / Raktaja Types according to Sushruta Samhitaa Vaataja Pittaja Kaphaja Saannipaatika Abhighaataja Pureeshaja As`hmareeja S`harkaraaja Types according to Maadhava Nidaana Vaataja Pittaja Kaphaja Saannipaatika S`halyaja Pureeshaja S`hukraja As`hmareeja (S`harkaraaja) Sampraapti:  Dosha singly or simultaneously get aggravated due to their causative factors. They harbor in to the Basti (Urinary Bladder) These aggravated Dosha cause damage to the Mootravaha Maarga (Urinary Tract) Ultimately, a person urinates with pain, which is called as Mootrakrichchhra.  Vaataja: There is severe pain at the Vamkshan`a region, Basti, Med`hra. The amount of urine is less. This is Vaataja Mootrakrichchhra. According to Sus`hruta, there is relatively less urination. Pittaja: Pittaja Mootrakrichchhra is a condition where urination is yellow coloured, blood stained, painful and with burning sensation. According to Sus`hruta, there is Haaridra coloured urination. Patient feels as if it is burnt by Agni. Kaphaja: There is S`hotha, Gurutva (heaviness) in the Basti. The urination is with Pichchha (like the scum of boiled rice). According to Sus`hruta, there is bristling of the hairs in Kaphaja Mootrakrichchhra. Saannipaatika: All the symptoms and signs get manifested in this Saannipaatika Mootrakrichchhra. This is more severe than other types. According to Sus`hruta, there is burning sensation or cold sensation while urination. The urine becomes multicoloured. There is Tamahpraves`ha. Mootraas`hmaree: Vaayu dries out the S`hukra or Pitta or Kapha in the urine, which leads in to the stone or gravel formation like a bright yellow orpiment prepared from the bile of cattle (Gorochana). In other texts four types of As`hmaree are described Vaataja Pittaja Kaphaja S`hukraja Sus`hruta has explained the involvement of Kapha in all the types of As`hmaree.  The gravel formed resembles to the flower of Kadamba having three compartments (Triput`ee), when it is caused due to Vaata. It is smooth (S`hlakshn`a) when it is caused due to Pitta. It is Mridu when this gravel is formed due to Kapha. This gravel obstructs the urinary tract (Mootramaarga) causing pain in the Basti, Sevanee and Mehana. The flow of the urine becomes shattered (Vis`heern`a). A person feels squeezing in the penis (Mridgaati). There is severe pain. A person urinates and evacuates stools frequently. This gravel may cause ulcer in the urinary tract. This may lead to the heamaturia. When this gravel gets passed then a person can urinate without pain. Mootras`harkaraa: When the gravel in the Urinary tract breaks out due to the Vaayu, then this gravelly mould passes out through urinary tract, this is called Mootras`harkaraa. This Mootras`harkaraa is not considered as different entity; but it is included under Mootraas`hmaree only. (Retas) Abhighaataja: When the natural urges related to S`hukra are suppressed, then it causes Mootrakrichchhra. There is pain in the Vamkshan`a, Basti, Med`hra. There is severe pain in the Vrishan`a. This obstructed S`hukra causes obstruction in the flow of urine causing painful micturition. This is Retas Abhighaataja Mootrakrichchhra. There is rigidity in the scrotum (An`d`a Stabdhataa) This is Reto Abhighaataja Mootrakrichchhtra. S`hukraja Mootrakrichchhra: Dosha obstruct S`hukra in the Mootraas`haya (Basti) causing obstruction in the urination. This manifests with the Mehana, Basti S`hoola. There is urination with the S`hukra. Basti and Vrishan`a become rigid (Stabdha), oedematous (S`hoona) and with severe pain (Bhris`ha Vedanaa) Kshataja or Kshayaja (Raktaja) Mootrakrichchhra: Due to S`hukra Kshaya or Kshata in the urinary tract, there is Vibaddhatva of Basti (obstructed). If urine gets retained for longer duration, then there is sever pain and there may be formation of As`hmaree. There is Basti Aadhmaana and Basti Gurutaa. When this urine gets passed out then there is Basti Laghutaa. This Kshataja or Kshayaja Mootrakrichchhra is also called as Raktaja Mootrakrichchhra. Chakrapaan`i says that Mootraaghaata explained in Sootrasthaana of Charaka Samhitaa are described in Chikitsaasthaana of Charaka Samhitaa as Mootrakrichchhra. Ch. Chi. 26.43-44 Chakrapaan`i S`halyaja Mootrakrichchhra: Due to any foreign body, the trauma is caused in the Mootravaha Srotas which causes severe Mootrakrichchhra. The symptoms are same as of Vaataja Mootrakrichchhra. Pureeshaja Mootrakrichchhra: Due to obstruction of stools, there is Vigun`atva of Vaayu. This causes Aadhmaana, Vaatas`hoola and Mootrasang. This retention of urine (Mootrasanga) is a causative factor of As`hmaree. S`hukraja Mootrakrichchhra: S`hukra vitiated due to Doshatraverse to the Mootra maarga. This causes painful micturation with the S`hukra. There is Basti, Mehana S`hoola. This is S`hukraja Mootrakrichchhra. As`hmareeja Mootrakrichchhra: As`hmaree and S`harkaraa both have same symptoms and signs. When in a gravel which is Pachyamaana by Pitta and S`hoshyamaan`aa by Vaayu, also which is losing its bonds (Vimukta Kapha Sandhaana), turns in to the S`harkaraa. There is Hrit Peed`aa, Vepathu, Kukshi S`hoola and Agni Daurbalya. When this gravel passes out, the pain gets specified.

Mootraaghaata Types: Comparative Study Mootrraukasaada: When Pitta or Kapha or Both gets solidified in the Basti, due to Vaata; then there is Rakta, Peeta and Ghana (viscid) urination. There is burning micturation. The urine turns in to white colour and it becomes Saandra viscid. This may happen due to Vaata Kapha or Pitta Vaata or Tridosha. This may manifest with all the symptoms. This is called as Mootraukasaada. This is Piittakrita Vikaara according to Sus`hruta. This Pitta gets dried in the Basti like Gorochana. This also causes due to Kapha, where Kapha gets dried up in the Basti. Vaagbhat`a and Maadhava Nidaana named it as Mootra Saada. Mootrajat`hara Due to suppression of natural urge of urine Vaayu gets aggravated (Vaatodaavarta). This distends the abdomen causing pain without any cause. There is Apakti (indigestion), Mootra Sanga, Vit` Sanga. This is Mootra Jat`hara. According to Maadhava Nidaana and Sus`hruta, there is Apaana Prakopa, which inflates the abdomen. Mootra Krichchhra When Mootra Vega is present, and in this condition when sexual act is performed by a person; then the Retas lifted up by the Vaata gets secreted out before or after the urine, then it is called as Mootra Krichchhra. Maadhava Nidaana, Vaagbhat`a and Sus`hruta has described it as Mootra S`hukra. In this Mootra resembles to Bhasmodaka. Mootrotsanga Due to vitiation of Mootravaha Srotas (Kha Vaigun`ya) and Vaata Aakshepa (Prakopa); there is no withholding of urine but it retains at the joint of the Man`i Sandhi. This retained urine gets passed out afterwards with or without pain. There is heaviness (gurutaa) in the penis (Uchchheshagurus`hephas). According to Sus`hruta, the urine gets retained in the Med`hra or Man`i. It may pass with Blood (Sarakta). Mootra (Sam)Kshaya It is manifested with symptoms of Vaata Prakopa. There is S`hosha (desiccation) of urine. This is Mootra Samkshaya. According to Sus`hruta, Pitta and Vaata residing at Basti causes Daaha, Vedanaa causing deception of Urine. Mootraateeta When the urine is retained for long time, then at the time of urination; it does not pass out easily. It passes slowly, called as Mootraateeta. (Vaataa) Asht`heelaa Aggravated Vaayu causes Basti Aadhmaana (inflated Basti) and obstruction of Guda (Guda Rodha). Ultimately, it results in the elevated and mobile (Chala) globular swelling called as Asht`heelaa. There is severe pain also. This Asht`heelaa causes obstruction of Pureeshavha and Mootravaha Srotas. According to Vaagbhat`a and Sus`hruta, the Granthi is not Chala (it is stable). According to Maadhava Nidaana, Asht`heelaa is Chala. Vaatabasti In a person who suppresses natural urge of urine, Vaayu gets aggravated manifesting with Mootra Rodha, Arti (pain), Kan`d`oo called as VaataBasti. According to Vaagbhat`a, in a person who suppresses the urge of urine, Vaayu obstructs the opening of the Basti (Basti Mukha). It manifests with Mootra Sanga, Rujaa, Kan`d`oo. There may be the displacement of the Basti and then it resembles to the Garbha. There is Rug, Daaha, Spandana, Udvesht`ana. The urine passes drop by drop; when it is manipulated, a stream of the urine gets passed. This is Krichchhrasaadhya. Another type of the VaataBasti is due to only Vaata Dosha and it is more difficult to treat. It is Dustaratara. This Vaatabasti of Vaagbhat`a resembles to the BastiKun`d`ala of Charaka. This is Krichchhrasaadhya according to Maadhava Nidaana. Ushn`avaata Due to heat, hot urine, which is Rakta and Peeta, is passed with pain. There is Basti, Upastha S`hoola and Daaha. According to Sus`hruta, there is Vaataavrita Pitta at the Basti. There is Daaha in Basti, Med`hra, Guda. Vaatakun`d`alikaa Due to Gati Sanga (immobilization of Vaayu), it gets upward direction (Udaavarta). This Vaayu harbors in the Mootra Shtaana and Maarga which is whirling. This Vaayu ultimately, obstructs Mootra manifesting with Stambha, Bhanga, Gaurava, Vesht`ana. There is severe pain, Mootra and Vit` Sanga. This is called as Vaata Kun`d`alikaa. Mootra Granthi (Rakta Granthi) At the mouth of Basti, there is formation of gland (Granthi), due to vitiation of Rakta by Vaata and Kapha. This obstructs the urine and painfully passed out. There is a pain resembling to the As`hmaree. It is called as Rakta Granthi. Vid`vighaata Vid`yukto Vighaatah Vid`Vighaatah | C.Si.9/43 In a Rooksha and Durbala person, when Pureesha is carried in to the Mootravaha Srotas, then there is stool-smelled urination. This is called as Vid`vighaata. BastiKun`d`ala Due to the causative factors, Basti is turned up and remain there like Garbha. There is S`hoola, Spandana, Daaha. The urine is passed drop by drop. When the Basti is manipulated, it passes with stream of urine. There is pain also. This is Basti Kun`d`ala, a serious and acute disease. When this Vaatakun`d`ala is caused by Vaata, then it is Asaadhya. When there is association of Pitta, then it manifests with Daaha, S`hoola, Mootra Vivarn`ataa. When there is association of Kapha, then it manifests with Gaurava, S`hopha, Snigdha, Ghana and Sita Mootrataa.

Svaroopa: Paan`d`u is indicative of yellowish white colour of the skin. The disease is Pitta Pradhaana. The person feels heaviness and laxity in his Dhaatu. The physical strength of a patient is also reduced. Rakta and Medas are decreased hence the person gets emaciated. The perception ability of a patient by the sense organs also gets reduced. There may be the manifestation of other Colours on the skin Krishn`a (black), Peeta (yellow) due to Dosha. But mostly the disease gets manifested with the Paan`d`u Varn`a, therefore the disease is called as Paan`d`u. (Su. U. 44/1, 4 D`alhan`a). Types: Some scholars are of belief that Paan`d`u is of 8 types. (S.U.44/4 D`alhan`a) Vaataja Paan`d`u Pittaja Paan`d`u Kaphaja Paan`d`u Saannipaatika Paan`d`u Mrid Bhakshan`aja S`haakhaaS`hrita Kaamalaa Kosht`haas`hrita Kaamalaa Haleemaka Types  Charaka, Asht`aanga Hridaya Vaataja Pittaja Kaphaja Saannipaataja Mrid Bhakshan`aja Types  Sus`hruta Vaataja Pittaja Kaphaja Saannipaatika Sus`hruta has counted Mrid Bhakshan`aja Paan`du in Saannipaataja Paan`d`u. S.U. 44/4 D`alhan`a. Saannipaatika Paan`d`u reveals all the signs and symptoms due to individual Dosha. C.Chi. 16/26 Sus`hruta has not counted it as different type of disease Paan`d`u, as eating clay aggravates the Dosha as per the Rasa (taste) of it. Ultimately, it is counted under Dosha type of Paan`d`u. Sampraapti: Pitta dominant Dosha is responsible in pathogenesis of Paan`d`u. They are aggravated in the Dhaatu causing S`haithilya (laxity) and Gaurava (heaviness) in the Dhaatu. There is decrease in the qualities of Ojas. The complexion, strength (physical) and unctuousness (Sneha) decreases. The patient gets emaciated. Rakta and Meda Dhaatu both are emaciated. The optimum qualities of the Dhaatu get decreased (Nihsaara) The Indriya become unable to percept. Colour of the patient gets changed (Vaivarn`ya) Though there is aggravation of Pitta, the harbour of Pitta I. e. Rakta does not increase. This is because the aggravated Pitta decreases the Rasa Dhaatu which nourishes the Rakta Dhaatu. The aggravated Pitta gets harboured in the heart (Hridaya). This Pitta is thrown away by the Vaayu which enters in to the Das`ha Dhamanee. Through these Dhamanee, the Pitta spread all over the body beneath the skin and muscular tissue. (Tvak and Maamsa Antaram) After reaching there, Pitta vitiates Vaata, Kapha, Rakta, Tvak and Maamsa. This results in the change in the skin Colour to Paan`d`u (Yellowish white), Haaridra (Yellow), Harita (greenish) This is Paan`d`u. Paan`d`u, Haaridra and Harita are the different Colours which are manifested on the skin. Amongst these Colours, Paan`d`u is the mostly manifested Colour of the skin. Therefore, the disease is called as Paan`d`u. Sus`hruta, Maadhava Nidaana Aggravated Dosha vitiate Rakta Dhaatu and change the skin to Paan`d`u Varn`a. (Paan`d`urataa) Actually, Tvak and Maamsa both also are counted as Dooshya in Paan`d`u. Haarita counts Rasa Dhaatu as a Dooshya in Paan`d`u. (M.Ni. 8/2 Madhukos`ha) Mrid Bhakshan`aja Paan`d`u: Due to clay eating one of the Dosha gets aggravated. Clay of astringent taste aggravates Vaayu. Clay of alkaline nature aggravates Pitta. Clay of Madhura taste aggravates Kapha. Due to its dryness, it makes the Dhaatu and food dry. This clay fills and obstructs the channels in the body. The perceptive capacity of the sense organs lowers down. The physical strength, Veerya, Ojas get hampered. Patient suffers form Oedema on Akshi Koot`a (periphery of the eyes), eyebrows, cheek area (Gan`d`a), umbilicus and penis (Med`hra) .

It means to void or pass urine, make water upon, to cause to make water. Increase in amount (Prabhoota Mootra) and turbidity of urine (Aavila Mootra) are the characteristic symptoms of Prameha. All the three Doshas are responsible for 20 types of Prameha and all other related diseases. General Aetiology of disease General Sampraapti In occurrence of any disease, following steps necessarily happen As causative factors (Nidaana) are similar to the Dosha by their attributes they will aggravate the Dosha (Dosha Janana) These aggravated Dosha are responsible for occurrence of disease in accordance with causative factors. the diseases will manifest immediately the diseases will be strong and the disease will manifest with all its symptoms the disease may not manifest at all the disease may manifest slowly or after prolonged period the disease may manifest with mild form the disease may manifest with out all the symptoms The disease will simply get manifested. The disease will manifest immediately. The disease will be strong in nature. The disease will manifest with all the symptoms. Dosha S`hleshmaa (having liquidity in excess /devoid of its natural density) Pitta Vaayu Dooshya Rasa (which is like Oja) - in excess (Bahu) A person suffering with Prameha feels to sit if he is walking. He wishes to have relaxed position when he sits. He prefers to sleep when he is relaxing. S.Ni.6/25 Vis`hesha Sampraapti S`hleshmaja Prameha To have a disease like Prameha it is the most important fact the S`hleshmaa should be in excess in the body (Praag Ati Bhooyastvaat) For a disease like Prameha t manifest it is a prerequisite that the S`hleshmaa be aggravated due to the causes. In this condition, due to the combination of causative factors, Dosha and Dooshya S`hleshmaa get aggravated immediately. Due to the aggravation and depending upon the specific causative factor it reaches various Dooshaya. As the body has become flaccid (S`haithilya) already, this aggravated S`hleshmaa spreads all over the body. The fluid predominant Shleshmaa, the lax constituents spread all over the internal environment. While spreading in the body, first of all this S`hleshmaa gets mixed with Medas Dhaatu, as the qualities of Medas Dhaatu are closely similar (Samaana Gun`a Bhooyisht`ha) to S`hleshmaa. Qualities of Medas like Madhura, Snigddha, Guru, S`heeta are also the qualities of S`hleshmaa. This happens according to Saamaanya Vis`hesha Siddhaanta that due to similarity similar thing gets increased. (Samaanam Hi Samaanena Milati Iti Bhaavah) Being comparable with Shleshmaa in all respects the vitiated liquid Shleshmaa reaches the Meda first and Harbours itself there. The spread of S`hleshmaa is enhanced by liquidity (Abaddhatva) and excessive amount (Bahutva) of Medas Dhaatu. As S`hleshmaa is already vitiated, it vitiates Medas after getting mixed with it (S`hleshmaa). The powerful Dosha vitiated Shleshmaa vitiates the Meda This vitiated S`hleshmaa collectively with vitiated Medas gets mixed up with body fluid (S`hareera Kleda) and Maamsa Dhaatu as these two factors Viz., body fluid and Maamsa have already exceeded their quantity. Thus, Maamsa Dhaatu also gets vitiated. The combination of Shleshmaa and Meda further mixes with other body constituents like Maamsa, the Kleda increasing them substantially. Ultimately, putrefied carbuncles (Pooti Maamsa Pid`akaa) are formed in Maamsa Dhaatu; they are named as S`haraavikaa, Kachchhapikaa etc. These carbuncles are formed due to the vitiation of Maamsa Dhaatu (Aprakritibhootatvaat) The fluid predominant combination when reaches the skin layers the Pitta, Vaata and Rasa, Laseeka get putrefied and manifest as eruptions which are known as Prameha Pid`akaa / carbuncles. Further, body fluid gets vitiated and transformed in to urine. This collectively increased fluid on reaching the Basti / urinary bladder is expelled with increased frequency and turbidity. Vankshan`a (Groin Region) and Basti (Urinary Bladder) are the two roots (controlling organs) of the channel carrying urine (Mootravaha Srotas). Medas and Kleda (Body fluid) clogs the channel carrying urine (Pratirudhyaat) Thus, S`hleshmaa get vitiated by its all the attributes and as it remains already aggravated this vitiation becomes stable and this excessive vitiation leads to incurability of disease. (Prakritivikritibhootatvaat) When this S`hleshmaa merges in Vasaa or Medas due to their analogous attributes, the disease is at its severe stage. (Balitva) Whereas when S`hleshmaa merges in S`hon`ita etc. I.e. Dooshya different in attributes to S`hleshmaa, the disease like Prameha becomes difficult to treat. (Viruddhopakrama). Then the disease stables and further gets the incurable status. Viruddhopakrama is a situation that when Vaidya tries to pacify S`hleshmaa by means of hot drugs, simultaneously it vitiates S`hon`ita as it is hot in nature. This mutual contradiction leads to the incurability of disease. Body fluids mixed with S`hleshmaa and Medas enter into the Basti and gets transformed into urine. During this process this urine acquire the 10 morbid qualities of S`hleshmaa Viz., S`hveta, S`heeta, Moorta, Pichchhila, Achchha, Snigdha, Guru, Madhura, Saandraprasaada, Manda. The name of the type of Prameha is allotted on the basis of the attribute of the S`hleshmaa which gets manifested on urine (Gaun`am Naamasamaakhyam). The attribute of S`hleshmaa manifests on urine as it is excessively increased. The 10 types of S`hleshmaja Prameha are manifested in accordance with the permutation and combination of attributes of S`hleshmaa. (Ekena Anekena Vaa Bhooyastaram Upasrijyate) The 10 types of S`hleshmaja Prameha are Udaka Meha watery urination. Ikshuvaalikaarasa Meha urine resembles to sugarcane juice. Saandra Meha viscid urination. Saadraprasaada Meha urine coagulates and renders to clear little bit. S`hukla Meha urine turns to white Colour and resembles to flour. S`hukra Meha urines like semen or it mixes with semen. S`heeta Meha urine tastes highly sweet and cold to touch. Sikataa Meha urine with gravel. S`hanaih Meha slow and sluggish urination. Aalaala Meha lubricous, fibrous, filamentous and saliva like urination It is only about S`hleshmaja Meha that 10 qualities of S`hleshmaa produce 10 types of Prameha by permutation and combination. This thing cannot happen with other Dosha. It is true that the fact that is seen with eyes can be discussed. Vis`hesha Sampraapti Pittaja Prameha As explained in the S`hlaishmika Prameha, there is a prerequisite that S`hleshmaa should have been aggravated. Due to the indulgence in causative factors of Pitta, it gets aggravated immediately. As explained for S`hlaishmika Prameha, the same pathogenesis happens to manifest 6 types of Prameha due to Pitta, immediately. With respect to S`hlaishmika Prameha, Pittaja Prameha manifest quickly as Pitta is sharp in nature. The types of Pittaja Prameha are named according to the qualities of Pitta. They are Kshaara Meha alkaline urine similar in aspect of smell, Colour, taste and touch Kaala Meha unobstructed black Coloured urine Neela Meha acidic and dark blue Coloured urine Lohita Meha bloody, raw meat smelling like and salty urine Maanjisht`ha Meha dark red / blackish red Coloured urine like decoction of Rubia Cordifolia (Manjisht`Haa) Haaridra Meha Yellow Coloured urine like decoction of curcuma Longa (Turmeric Haridraa) The attributes of Pitta responsible for Pittaja Prameha are Kshaara (alkaline), Amla (sour), Lavan`a (Salty), Kat`uka (pungent), Visra (smelling of raw meat), Ushn`a (hot). All the types of Pittaja Prameha are palliative (Yaapya). These types of Pittaja Prameha cannot be completely cured, as there is mutual contradiction in treating them. In Pittaja Prameha, Pitta harbours in Medas. The site of Prameha is Medas that vitiates in pathogenesis of this disease. To pacify Pitta cold potency drugs and sweet foodstuffs are to be used but they are favourable to Medas and to pacify Medas pungent drugs are to be used but they are favourable to increase Pitta, so it becomes complicated to treat Pittaja Prameha. This is called as Viruddhopakrama. Chakrapaan`i said that due to Vyaadhi Prabhaava Pittaja Prameha can not be treated easily. Vis`hesha Sampraapti Vaataja Prameha S`hleshmaa should have been aggravated. Vaata gets immediately aggravated in a person who indulges in Vaata aggravating factors. When this aggravated Vaayu, while spreading through the body takes Vasaa with it and reaches to channels of urine (Mootravaha Srotas), it manifests Vasaa Meha . When Vaayu forces Majjaa to bladder, then Meha manifested is Majja Meha. When Laseekaa (Yat Maamsa Tvag Antare Udakam, tat Laseekaa S`habdam Labhate | Ch. S`haa. 7) (Lymph), due to its excess amount and dissipation quality of Vaayu, enters in to urinary bladder, person urines profusely and continuously (Ajasram) but with Sanga (stagnation) (Sa Avas`hesha Mootra Ati Ksharan`a Gangaadhara) like an elephant, this is Hasti Meha. Oja is Madhura in nature. When due to dryness (Raukshya) Vaayu converts Maadhurya of Oja into Kashaaya (astringent) taste and takes it into the urinary bladder, Madhu Meha gets manifested. These 4 types of Vaataja Prameha are incurable as they are very serious and also because of contraindication involved in their treatment. It is very serious as it passes the essence of Dhaatus through urine out of the body. This is incurable due to Viruddhopakrama. It means that unctuous things useful to pacify Vaayu aggravate Medas and dry things useful to lower down Medas increase Vaayu. These 4 types of Vaataja Prameha are named after the attributes involved in the pathogenesis. These are Vasaa Meha oily and repeated urination Majja Meha urine mixed with Majja and repeated urination Hasti Meha large quantity of urine passing continuously like a passionate elephant. Madhu Meha urine turns to sweet and astringent in taste, pale in Colour and dry in nature. One who is very passionate to eat and envies to bath and walk (reluctant to exercise) could be captured by Prameha like a bird that reaches to its nest very quickly. Prameha is seen in those people who are lazy, less enthusiastic, obese, over unctuous and eat excessively, gluttonous (Audarika). Actually, a person who takes wholesome diet and resorts, which bring about the normal state of the Dhaatu in the body leads to happy life. Prameha Types: Comparative Study ( ) = names as given in Ch.Chi. 6 * = as per Madhukosha T`eekaa M.N. 33.7-12 Kaphaja Mehaa (10 types) are curable (Saadhya) Pittaja Mehaa (6 types) are palliative (Yaapya) Vaataja Mehaa (4 types) are incurable (Asaadhya) C.Chi.6/7 As per the combinations of Dosha, Dooshya Prameha gets manifested. These types of Prameha are Categorised on the basis of Colour (Varn`a), smell (Gandha), taste (Rasa), touch (SparS`ha) of urine. A.H.Ni.10/7, 8 Sampraapti 1 - Prameha (C.Chi.6/ 5, 6) Kapha aggravates due to its causative factors, like Aasyaa etc. Kapha vitiates Medas, Maamsa and Kleda (body fluid) which are located in Basti. This is the basic cause of Meha. (Kaphaja Meha) Similarly, Pitta aggravated due to hot things vitiates Medas, Maamsa, Kleda situated in the Basti causes Meha. (Pittaja Meha) When other two Dosha (Pitta and Kapha) are relatively diminished, the aggravated Vaayu takes away the Dhaatu (Majja, Oja and Laseekaa Chakrapaan`i C.Chi.6/6) to Basti (urinary bladder) causing Meha. (Vaataja Meha) Sampraapti 2 - Prameha (A.H.Ni.10/4) Vitiated Kapha Harbouring in bladder (Basti) and vitiating body fluid (Kleda), sweat (Sveda), Medas (Adipose tissue), Rasa and Maamsa, lead to Prameha. When Kapha and all other cold natured factors are diminished (Kaphaadau Ksheen`e sati) then Pitta and Rakta both Harbouring in urinary bladder give rise to Prameha. Vaayu takes the (Dhaatu) towards bladder. On the other way due to the depletion of Dhaatu, Vaayu lead to Prameha. Saamaanya Sampraapti 3- Prameha In general, respective Dosha traverse through the body to Basti (urinary bladder) vitiating urine (Mootra) generate respective types of Meha. C.Chi.6/6 Different types of Prameha as mentioned above are characterized by Varn`a (Colour), Rasa (Taste), Spars`ha (Touch) and Gandha (Smell) of urine. C.Chi.6/12 It means that the type of Prameha should be diagnosed on the basis of urine examination looking at Varn`a, Rasa, SparS`ha, Gandha of urine. When urine turns to dark brown (S`hyaava) and reddish brown (Arun`a Varn`a), when urine resembles to the attributes of Majja etc., Dhaatu, also a person experiencing pain, then these are symptoms that Vaataja Prameha has turned to incurable status (Asaadhya) C.Chi.6/12 If the Colour of urine is yellow or when Hematurea is there, without the Poorvaroopa (premonitory symptoms) of Prameha, this condition should be diagnosed as Raktapitta instead of Prameha. C.Chi.6/54 The patients who are Pramehee or Madhumehee (diabetic) right from the birth (Jaata Pramehee congenital) and those who are borne of Pramehee or Madhumehee (diabetic) parents (Kulaja - hereditary) are not curable (Asaadhya). Not only Prameha or Madhumeha but all other Kulaja (hereditary) diseases are also incurable. C.Chi.6/57 Beeja Dosha (genetic cause) is the major factor in this aspect. Beeja (S`hukra or S`hon`ita) itself is affected by the factors that are responsible for manifestation of Prameha or Madhumeha. The word Meha is generally applied to all types of Prameha; on the other hand the word Madhumeha is applied to Madhumeha and also to all types of Prameha.(Chakrapaan`i) Prameha is Anushangee Vikaara. C.Su.25 There is a possibility to happen Prameha in the progeny. Anushangee is Punarbhaavee as explained by Chakrapaan`i. Aachaarya Charaka has explained pathogenesis in Sootrasthaanas 17 th chapter (Kiyantahshiraseeya) C.Su.17.78-89 The pathogenesis happens in a person, who is eating heavy, unctuous, sour (Amla), salty (Lavan`a), in excess amount, newly arrived grains, who enjoys sleep (sedentary life) and remain at a place for longer time without moving here and there, who does not exercise, who does not have any stress and enjoys life completely, who never carry out cleansing processes (Panchakarma therapies); a person with these hobbits is more prone to have Prameha. This is a prerequisite for Prameha. In such person, S`hlshmaa, Pitta, Medas and Maamsa aggravate vigorously. The path of Vaayu gets obstructed (Aavrita Gati) and so Vaayu together with Ojas traverse to Basti (urinary bladder) causing the obstinate type of disease called Madhumeha. In this disease, the signs and symptoms of Madhumeha are seen according to the Dosha. Vaata, Pitta and Kapha manifest their signs and symptoms repeatedly. They vanish at times and reoccur again. If this disease is not treated properly or neglected, it causes more serious seven types of carbuncles. These carbuncles are named as Prameha Pid`akaa. These appear at Marma, joints (Sandhi) of the body, muscular areas, porous areas (AvakaaS`ha). These Prameha Pid`akaa are S`haraavikaa Kachchhapikaa Jaalinee Sarshapee Alajee Vinataa Vidradhee Sampraapti 4 - Prameha A person can be diseased who has sedentary habits, reluctant to exercise, lazy, consuming a food that is cold, unctuous, sweet, fatty, excess liquid. This is a prerequisite that in a person with such Habbits only a disease like Prameha will manifest. In above-mentioned person, Aakva Aama (Unripe (raw)) Dosha are the major factor. These all three Dosha, when combine with Medas, travel in the body in downward direction towards Mootravaha Storas. They Harbour in to Basti Mukha and are urinated. S.Ni.6/4 Prameha Pid`Kaa also are caused due to all the three Dosha. S.Ni.6/7 Types Kaphaja Prameha - 10 types S.Ni.6/8 Udaka Meha Ikshuvaalikaa Meha Suraa Meha Sikataa Meha Shanaih Meha Lavan`a Meha Pisht`a Meha Saandra Meha S`hukra Meha Phena Meha Pittaja Prameha - 10 types S.Ni.6/8 Neela Meha Haridraa Meha Amla Meha Kshaara Meha Manjisht`ha Meha S`hon`ita Meha Vaataja Prameha - 10 types S.Ni.6/11 Sarpi Meha Vasaa Meha Kshaudra Meha Hasti Meha Although, 20 types of Prameha are explained on the basis of Dosha, there may be many permutations and combinations to have more and more types. For example, if we permute and combine 5 Colours then depending upon the combination we will have many types of Colours. The same situation happens here regarding types of Prameha. S.Ni.6/ 26 Sushruta has classified Prameha in to S.Chi.11/3 Sahaja (right from the birth) due to genetic reason Apathya Nimittaja (due to unwholesome practices) Vagbhat`a has classified Prameha in to A.H.Ni.10/18 When Vaayu aggravates due to depletion of Dhaatu and generates Prameha When Vaayu becomes stagnant due to covering by Dosha When Vaayu gets covered by Dosha etc. the symptoms are suddenly manifested as Vaayu is of Chala (moving) attribute. Suddenly, urinary bladder gets filled by urine or remain empty. So when Prameha happens due to Aavaran`a of Vaayu by other entities it turns to Krichchhrasaadhya (difficultly curable) state, while when Prameha happens due to depletion of Dhaatu it remains Asaadhya (incurable). A.H.Ni.10/19 When Prameha is Dhaatukshayaja (Kevala Vaataja), symptoms related to Vaayu only manifest. In this type there is no Aavaran`a. Where as, Gadaadhara says that Madhumeha happens due to only Aavaran`a. He quotes reference of Charaka as C.Su.17/78-89 All types of Prameha turns to Madhumeha when neglected or not treated. Generally, in all types of Prameha, urine turns to sweet taste and it resembles to honey (Madhu) by means of Colour, touch, taste, and smell. A.H.Ni.10/21 In other words, in a patient with Prameha, the body is completely enriched by sweetness.

Site of Prameha Pid`akaa - These Pid`akaa are seen at muscular area, Marma spots, and at joints. S`haraavikaa  it is like S`haraava. Kachchhapikaa  it is like back of the tortoise. Jaalinee  It has network of vessels on its surface. Vinataa  It is seen on back or abdomen. Sarshapee  it resembles to mustard seeds. Alajee  it is very painful due to burning sensation like fire. Vidradhi Types - Baahya -It originates from skin, Snaayu and Maamsa. It resembles to tendons and is extremely painful. Aabhyantara -Dosha when enter interior of the body affecting Maamsa and Rakta (Asra), thereby causes deep seated abscess (Granthi), which is very painful. This Aabhyantar (internal) Vidradhi may happen at heart (Hridaya), Kloma, Yakrit (Liver), Pleehaa (Spleen), Kukshi (Flanks), Vrikka (kidneys), Naabhi (Umbilicus), Vamkshan`a or Basti (Urinary Bladder). Due to vitiation of Blood (Rakta), the Vidradhi get suppurated quickly, due to this quick suppuration only, it is called as Vidradhi. (Tatah Sheeghra Vidaahitvaat Vidradhi Iti Abhidheeyate | C.Su.17/95) Vidradhi again can be classified as - Vaatika Paittika S`hlaishmika Saannipaatika When this Vidradhi suppurates completely and get ruptured, then if Vidradhi is situated at upper side of the body, it discharges out through mouth. If Vidradhi is situated at lower side of the body, it discharges out through the anus. When the Vidradhi is at umbilicus, after ripening it discharges through both mouth and anus. Completely ripened Vidradhi at Hridaya, Naabhi and Basti and Saannipaatika Vidradhi are incurable. They lead to death. So as soon as a person affects from Vidradhi, one should immediately get treated by Snehana, Virechana therapy. The general rule to treat Vidradhi is like Gulma. It is necessary that Vidradhi should be treated before the complications are manifested. Actually, Pid`akaa related to Prameha and those which are manifesting without Prameha have same line of treatment, as Dosha and Dooshya both are same in these types. D`alhan`a. Su. Chi. 12 It has been described that Pid`akaa are manifested due to negligence to treat Prameha. But it is also possible that without Prameha, Pid`Kaa can be manifested. Unless and until these Pid`Kaa get substantial root in the Dhaatu they are not manifested. S`haraavikaa, Kachchaapikaa and Jaalinee are difficult to tolerate and very serious in nature. They occur in such patients where Medas and Kapha are in excess. Sarshapee, Alajee, Vinataa and Vidradhi are due to dominance of Pitta and are possible in a person having moderately vitiated Medas and Kapha. These are curable. Asaadhya Vidradhi (Incurable condition) - If Pid`akaa are manifested in a patient suffering from Prameha, at Marma Sthaana, Amsa, Guda (Anal region), Stana (Breasts), Sandhi (Joints), Paada (feet), then this patient does not survive.

The Moon was exceedingly attached to Rohin`ee did not care for his health. He became emaciated due to depletion of Sneha (Unctuousness) Therefore, moon was not able to satisfy the sexual urge of the rest of the daughters of the Prajaapati. Due to which Prajaapatis anger came out of his mouth in the form of breath and took a physical form. The moon had earlier been married with the twenty eight daughters of Prajaapati. But he was unable to satisfy them all. Therefore the moon afflicted by Raajayakshmaa as a result of Prajaapatis expression of anger. Discriminatory treatment of moon with his wives resulted in to Raajayakshmaa to weakened moon. Moon lost his complexion due to the anger of Prajaapati and preponderance of Rajas. Accompanied by the gods and godly sages, he sought the shelter of Prajaapati. Being satisfied by the good intentions of moon, Prajaapati was pleased. The moon then treated by the As`hvinikumaara. The treatment increased his Oja and he got pure mind. (S`huddha Sattva) The Raajayakshmaa being expelled out by the As`hvini Kumaara from the heaven, came down to the world of human beings. Thus, this disease afflicts human being which is caused by four reasons. This story reveals that this is a Karmadoshaja Disease.

Types: Saahasaja Raajayakshmaa / Aaghaataja (due to over exercise and doing the acts beyond the capacity) (Vega) Sandhaaran`aja Raajayakshmaa (due to suppression of natural urges) Vaata, Mootra and Pureesha Vegaa only. Ch. Chi. 8; M. N. 10 T`eekaa Kshayaja Raajayakshmaa (due to emaciation of Dhaatu) VishamaaS`hanaja Raajayakshmaa (due to consumption of unwholesome diet) Saahasaja Raajayakshmaa When a weak person fights with a stronger one, exerts with too big bow (Dhanush), speaks to much, carries too big load, swims for a long distance, resorts to forceful massage and application of pressure by feet or runs fast to cover a long distance, subjects himself to assault, indulges himself in irregular exercises or in excessive exercises, his chest gets injured due to such exercises. (Urah Kshan`Yate) The injured place gets vitiated by Vaayu. This Vaayu afflicts Kapha which resides in the chest. It moves upward, downward and sideways, vitiating Pitta also. The portion of Vaayu, which affects the joints of the body causes yawing (Jrimbhaa), malaise (Angamarda) and fever (Jvara) The portion of Vaayu, which affects the AamaaS`haya, causes the diseases of chest (Urasya Vikaara) like Hrid Drava (palpitation), Hrid S`hoola (Cardiac pain) [Hrid Drava S`holaadayah Chakrapaan`I C.Ni.6/4] and anorexia (Arochaka) The portion of Vaayu, which affects the throat (Kan`t`ha) causes Kan`t`hoddhvansa (irritation of the throat) and Svara Avasaada. The portion of Vaayu, which affects the Praan`avaha Srotas, causes S`hvaasa (Dyspnoea) and Pratis`hyaaya. The portion of Vaayu, which affects the head (S`hiras), causes the damage to head. Due to irregular movements of Vaayu, injury in the chest, irritation of the throat, a patient suffers from constant cough (Kaasa Satatam ) Due to this cough, there is further injury to the chest and the patient spits the blood. Due to blood spitting, patient suffers from weakness. Thus, a patient suffers from the complications due to over exercise and doing the acts beyond the capacity. In this way Dhaatu start depleting which lead to further emaciation slowly. This is S`hosha (Raajayakshmaa) Vega Sandhaaran`aja Raajayakshmaa When an individual suppress the natural urges for passing flatus (Vaata), urine (Mootra) and stool (Pureesha) because of apprehension, pre-occupation, bashfulness or in front of king or while sitting at the feet of preceptor or while gambling or attending meetings of gentlemen, or in the midst of women or while traveling, the Vaayu gets aggravate. This Vaayu provoke Pitta and Kapha and along with them it moves upwards, downwards and sideways. Different parts of the Vaayu enter in to the different parts of the body causing pain (S`hoola) It causes diarrhea (Pureesha Bheda) or it dries up the Pureesha. It causes excessive pain in the sides of the chest (PaarS`hva Rujaa) It causes grinding pain in the Amsa (Shoulder region) It increases the respiratory movements of throat (Kan`t`ha) and chest (Uras) It damages head. It causes cough (Kaasa), Dyspnoea (S`hvaasa), fever (Jvara), hoarseness of voice (Svarabheda), Coryza (Pratis`hyaaya) Thus, these complications cause depletion of Dhaatu and causes emaciation slowly. This is Raajayakshmaa. Kshayaja Raajayakshmaa When a person is in excessive grief, worries, jealousy, anxiety, fear, anger, when a person indulges in Ununctuous diet and drinks, when a weak person indulges in lesser quantity food or in fasting; then Rasa Dhaatu residing at heart gets diminished.Due to this diminished Rasa, a person gets emaciated. If it remains Untrated, it may turn to Raajayakshmaa.Due to excessive passion in the sexual act, semen gets diminished due to over indulgence. If a mind does not get detached from woman even after diminution of semen and is still indulges in sexual act, he dies not have ejaculation of semen as already semen is diminished. During this, Vaayu enters in to the blood vessels of this individual leading to the ejaculation of blood through the channel for semen. It causes the symptoms of vitiated Vaata. Due to diminution of semen and discharge of blood, the joints become loose, Vaayu gets aggravated. This aggravated Vaayu, traverse thorough the empty body causing aggravation in Kapha and Pitta. These dry up the muscle Tisues (Maamsa) and blood (Rakta). It causes pain the side of the chest, grinding pain in the Amsa (shoulder), irritation in the throat, head becomes full of Kapha, vitiating Kapha; It produces malaise, anorexia, and indigestion after afflicting the joints. Due to vitiation of Pitta and Kapha and unwanted movements of Vaayu; fever, cough, Dyspnoea, hoarseness of voice, Coryza are manifested. When a patient coughs, as the chest is injured, the blood is spitted out. Due to this blood discharge, person feels weakness. Thereafter, due to depletion of Dhaatu, a person gets emaciated slowly. VishamaaS`hanaja Raajayakshmaa When a person indulges in diet without paying proper attention to Asht`au Aahaara Vidhi ViS`hesha Aayatana (Nature, Mode of Preparation, Combination, Quantity, Locality, Time, Diatetic rules and wholesomeness for the individual of diet), all the three Doshas get vitiated. (Vaishamya) These vitiated Dosha spread all over the body and obstruct the openings of the channels. In this condition, the food eaten by the individual is mostly converted to the stool and urine rather than Dhaatu. The afflicted person is sustained by the retention of the stool. Therefore, the fecal matter of individual suffering from emaciation should be retained. Dosha accumulated due to irregular diet, individually produce the complications in the body which is already emaciated which result in further emaciation. The blood spitted cough is produced. Due to this discharge of blood, a person gets weakness. This is Raajayakshmaa. (Anuloma Kshaya) In Raajayakshmaa though all three Dosha are responsible, they produce their symptoms having dominance of Kapha. The channels of Dhaatu get obstructed by Kapha. S.U.41/9 As the channel of Rasa Dhaatu is obstructed, the nutrient Aahaara Rasa can not get in to the next channel of Rakta. So Rakta Dhaatu remains unnourished. The same thing happens with the successive Dhaatu. Therefore, the Dhaatu remain unnourished and get depleted. This condition manifests on a person as emaciation (Kshaya / S`hosha). This is Raajayakshmaa. (Anuloma Kshaya)  This emaciation occur other way also. When a person engaged in sexual act excessively, semen gets diminished. If a person goes on with sexual act with already depleted semen, all other Dhaatu also get depleted. D`alhan`a says that when a pond dries up the aquatic animals do not enter in it, in the same way when S`hukra Dhaatu dries up all the previous Dhaatu too desiccate. (Pratiloma Kshaya) In MadhukoS`ha it is explained that due to depletion of S`hukra, Vaayu gets aggravated. This Vaayu desiccates nearest Dhaatu, Majjaa and this process of depletion of proximal Dhaatu goes on. Thus, Dhaatu get depleted in antecedent direction. This is Pratiloma Kshaya. Due to four causative factors of Raajayakshmaa Vaayu gets aggravated. It provokes Kapha and Pitta all over the body. This aggravated Vaayu enters into joints of body (S`hareera Sandhi) and Siraa. They obstruct or widen the openings of the channels and spread upward, downward or sideway in the body creating respective diseases. Why Dhaatu get depleted in Raajayakshmaa? (A. H. Ni.5.19-22) Raajayakshmaa: Lakshn`a - 1 # absence of Pratis`hyaaya = in Saahasaja Raajayakshmaa * combination of 3 Lakshan`aa as Triroopa Raajayakshmaa and specific different Lakshan`aas then other types.

Pooti Aasya Pratis`hyaaya In a person whose head is full of Vitiated Vaayu, the Kapha, Rakta and Pitta situated in the root of nasal passage (Ghraan`a Moola) moves towards the Vaayu as a result of which Pratis`hyaaya occurs, which is serious (Ghora) in nature. It causes emaciation of the body. C.Chi.8/48-50 Kaasa A patient spits out Rasa mixed with Kapha, while coughing which is slimy (Pichchhila), thick (Bahala), putrid (Visra), green, white or yellow in Colour. C.Chi.8/51 Jvara Burning sensation in the shoulders and sides of the chest, burning sensation in the hands and feet and fever; these are the characteristic features of Raajayakshmaa. C.Chi.8/52 Svarabheda Svarabheda is caused due to Vaayu, Pitta, Kapha, Kaasa, Peenasa. If manifests according to the causative factor. C.Chi.8/53-55 Paars`hvas`hoola and S`hirahs`hoola In Raajayakshmaa, pain in the sides of the chest is indeterminate. It sometimes related with contraction sometimes related with expansion of the chest. In Raajayakshmaa, headache is associated with burning sensation and with heaviness. Ch. Chi.8.56 Raktasht`heevana In Raajayakshmaa, when a person is emaciated, the accumulated and excited blood and Kapha comes out from the throat. Ch. Chi.8.57 Because of the obstruction in the channels of blood, it does not get converted into Maamsa. Thus, it gets accumulated in the AamaaS`haya and then excited, comes out through the throat. S`hvaasa and Ateesaara (Varchobheda) As the chest gets congested with Vaayu and Kapha, a person suffers from Dyspnoea. This patient passes the quantity of stool along with the mucus (Pichchha) because of the suppression of Agni by vitiated Dosha. C.Chi.8/59 Aruchi When the Dosha are situated at tongue and heart, they cause Aruchi (aversion for food or anorexia). It may be due to individual Dosha or due to all the Dosha. It may also be due to aversion for the object of gustatory sensation. The taste of the mouth becomes Kashaaya, Tikta, Madhura due to Vaata, Pitta and Kapha respectively. C.Chi.8/60-61 Chhardi Vomitting is caused by Arochaka, Kaasa, excited Dosha and fear (Bhaya) This vomiting might also occur as a complication in other diseases. C.Chi.8/62 Types of S`hosha S.U.41/16; M.N. 10.14-20 Vyavaaya S`hosha S`hoka S`hosha Sthaavirya S`hosha / Jaraa S`hosha Vyaayaama S`hosha Adhva S`hosha Upavaasa S`hosha Vran`a S`hosha Urah Kshata S`hosha Vyavaaya S`hosha It manifests with the same symptoms as of S`hukra Kshaya like penile and scrotal pain. Antecedent Dhaatu get depleted also. Patient becomes pale / yellowish white. S`hoka S`hosha A person Sinked with thinking more and more gets depleted. But here no symptoms of depletion of semen are present; all other symptoms of Vyavaaya S`hosha are present. Jaraa S`hosha In old age a person gets emaciated. The strength, intellect, perceptive capacity all gets reduced. There is tremor, anorexia, voice like sound of broken bronze vessel (Bhinna Kaamsya Paatrahata Svarah). A person spits without Kapha. He suffers from heaviness, excessive discharge from mouth, nose and eyes while feces are dry. The complexion gets dulled. Adhva S`hosha Due to excessive walking a person sinks, body parts become inactive, Kloma and Gala (throat) become dry. Vyaayaama S`hosha A person due to excessive physical exertion gets the symptoms same as of Adhva S`hosha. It also resembles to Urah Kshata but without wound in the chest. Vran`a S`hosha Due to depletion of Rakta, pain and restrictions in diet, Vran`a S`hosha occurs. This is incurable. Urahkshata S`hosha If a chest is injured due to excessive physical exercise, weight lifting, reading, trauma sexual activity, because of the wound in chest Kapha, Pus and blood comes out. While coughing yellow, red, black or reddish sputum expelled out. Due to the injury in the chest, he gets agonizing pain and then faints. Mouth and respiration have foul smell.

The body and Praan`a of living beings got heated by this fire. This resulted in the manifestation of Jvara which is followed by Raktapitta. Sampraapti Event Description Raktapitta 1. 2. 3. 4.

It gives certain rules to the followers for enjoying a healthy life. Some principles must be understood and implemented to prevent any diversion from Svaasthya, and many more aspects, are explained in this mesmerizing science. Rogamaarga is one such principle, which is an extremely essential principle to be studied, without its knowledge, implementation of Ayurveda will be like, driving a car without knowing where to fill petrol. Maarga primarily means a pathway or channel. In relation to the body, it means the pathway through which the different substances i.e. Bhaavapadaartha move in the body. The body is made up of innumerable such Maarga_s. The Siraa Dhamanee Srotas are all included in the Maarga. The movement of Vaata in the Vaatavahasiraa can be termed as one Maarga, the movement of Pitta in Pittavaha another Maarga; of Rakta in Raktavaha Siraa and so forth. The whole body is thus literally a collection of different Maarga_s put together. Maarga has also been used as a synonym for Srotas The movement of the Bhaavapadaartha from one part of the body to the other is essential for the digestion, nutrition and other functions to be carried out ceaselessly e.g. the function of Kledavahana is done relentlessly by Mootra. The function of circulation throughout the body is essential for the nutrition of the body. The movement of Vaata is essential for the different activities taking place throughout the body e.g. excretion of faeces, ingestion of food, stimulation of Paachakapitta etc. This movement is incessantly taking place in the body but on formation of pathological changes the movement is hampered and disease formation starts. These pathological changes can be of different kinds, like reduction of lumen (diameter) of the pathway due to different growths, inflammations, pressure, or lack of stimulation etc. Vyaanavaayu is a type of Vaayu responsible for the circulation of the Rasa Rakta in the body. This is essential for the nourishment of the body and is responsible for the physiological growth of all the Dhaatu_s. This nourishment is achieved by the proper circulation of the Rasa Rakta. To carry out the different functions of the body the secretion of the Dosha and their movements are essential. During this circulation when Rasadhaatu or the Dosha comes across any Khavaigun`ya i.e. weak organ, it gets stranded there and the disease formation takes place. To understand the pattern of disease formation, to have in depth knowledge of the body, in order to make the elimination of the disease easier, Ayurveda has put forth the concept of Rogamaarga. The Rogamaarga_s are the pathways on which the diseases are formed. They are divided according to the common pattern followed by the diseases in their wanted paths in the formation pattern. These Rogamaarga_s are as follows: The Kosht`ha Maarga The S`haakhaa Maarga The Marmaas`hrita Maarga Their synonyms are as follows: The Abhyantara Maarga or the Maarga most interiorly placed The Baahya Maarga-or the Maarga most exteriorly placed and The Madhyama Maarga the Maarga lying between both the earlier mentioned Maarga_s. Now let us see what these Maarga_s are all about The Kosht`ha Maarga First we will see what the word Kosht`ha literally means. It means any hollow space covered by borders of muscles. The word Abhyantara means the internal. The scientific meaning of the Kosht`ha Maarga is the Mahaanimna or the Gastro intestinal tract including the Aamaas`haya i.e. the stomach and Pakvaas`haya the intestines. The other organs included in the Kosht`ha Maarga are the Agnyaas`haya the pancreas the Mootraas`haya also known as the Basti or the urinary bladder, and the Raktaas`haya i.e. Yakrita (Liver) and the Pleeha, (i.e. the spleen). The Hridaya i.e. the heart, all these organs are included in the Kosht`ha Maarga. The Kosht`ha Maarga also includes the Rasa/Lymph Dhaatu in the heart and the Rakta Dhaatu present in the liver and spleen. The Rasa and Rakta Dhaatu_s present elsewhere are included in the S`haakhaa Maargaa. To conclude the Kosht`ha Maarga is comprised of The GI tract along with the stomach and intestines The pancreas The urinary bladder The liver and spleen The heart The caecum The lungs All these organs are present in the Kosht`ha i.e. the trunk of the body. The torso is the largest space surrounded by a covering and hence considered the biggest Kosht`ha in the body and anatomically also there are organs with spaces which can be filled with some substance e.g. air-in-lungs, Rasa and Rakta Dhaatu in heart, Mootra or urine in bladder and so on. Now we will see the different diseases included in this Maarga as described by Ayurveda. By its presence it is to be observed that the Sampraapti or pathogenesis occurs at a particular site, which is included in the Kosht`ha Maarga or the diseases known as Kosht`hashnit i.e. occurring in the Kosht`ha. These diseases are: 1.  Jvara -  Fever 2.  Atisaara -  Dysentery 3.  Chhardi -  Vomiting 4. Alasaka -  Type of indigestion 5.  Visoochikaa- Gastroenteritis 6.  Kaasa - Cough 7.  S`hvaasa - Breathlessness 8.  Hikkaa - Hiccough 9.  Aanaaha - Flatulence 10. Udara - Abdominal distension 11. Pleehaa - disease of spleen 12. Visarpa - Herpes 13. S`hvayathu- Swelling 14. Gulma - Growths 15. Ars`ha - Hemorrhoids 16. Vidradhi - Abscess S`haakhaa Maarga The S`haakhaa Maarga is the Maarga exteriorly placed in the body, hence it is also known as the Baahya Rogamaarga. Due to the exterior placement of the structures, it is compared to the S`haakhaa of the trees. Hence it is termed as the S`haakhaa Maarga. The S`haakhaa Maarga includes all the Dhaatu_s or tissues i.e. the Rakta, Maamsa, Meda, Asthi, Majjaa, S`hukra and the Tvachaa or the skin along with the Rasa Dhaatu. We saw in the Kosht`ha Maarga that all the spaces with covering were termed as Kosht`ha i.e. the spaces were Kosht`ha and the covering which is external to the core space, is to be termed as S`haakhaa. The S`haakhaa Maarga gets denser more developed more complex at each progressive step. Hence the diseases occurring in the succeeding Dhaatu_s become more difficult to treat than the previous ones. This is known as the Dhaatugataavasthaa. The Uttarottara Dhaatu_s are difficult to treat and are more and more vital. The disease occurring in the S`haakhaamaarga are: Gand`a Peed`akaa Alaji Apachi Charmakeela Adhimaamsa Mashaka Kusht`ha Vyanga Gulma Baahya Ars`ha Baahya Vidradhi Baahya Arbooda Baahya Visarpa There are many more diseases occurring in the S`haakhaa Maargaa. The Samhitaakaaras have mentioned the word Aadayah i.e. etc and hence kept open the inclusion of all the diseases whose pathogenesis occur in the S`haakhaa Maarga to be included in the S`haakhaa Maarga disease list. The Madhyama Maarga This is considered as the most important Maarga of the three Rogamaarga_s. It is known as the Madhyama Maarga because it lies between the peripheral S`haakhaa Maarga and the internal Kosht`ha Maarga. The Madhyama Maarga is spread all over the body and is not demarcated like the S`haakhaa or Kosht`ha Maarga. The structures to be included in the Madhyama Rogamaarga are: The Marma The Asthisandhi The Snaayukand`ara covering the Asthisandhi If we study minutely, we will find out that the bone joints, Asthi Sandhi are 210 in number and are spread throughout the body. The Marma or the vital points are 107 in number. And the Snaayu Kandara covering the Asthi Sandhi_s are also innumerable. All these structures are included in the Madhyama Maarga. We cannot segregate the S`haakhaa Maarga or the Koshth Maarga from the Madhyama Maarga. The Madhyama Maarga is an extension of the S`haakhaa Maarga and Kosht`ha Maarga. It has been devised as per the importance of the structures. The Asthi Sandhi found in the S`haakhaa are = 68 The Asthi Sandhi found in the Madhyama S`hareera = 59 The Asthi Sandhi found in the S`hira and above = 83 Though all Asthisandhi or bone joints are very important structures in the body and any disease occurring in them will be very painful with each movement of the body, special importance should be given to Asthisandhi, which have been included in the vital point category i.e. the Marma as they become a combined force of two sites as informed by the Ayurveda - the science. 1. Jaanu Sandhi  - 2 2. Koorpara Sandhi - 2 3. Seemanta - 2 4. Adhipati - 2 5. Gulpha - 2 6. Man`ibandha - 2 7. Kukundara - 2 8. Aavarta - 2 9. Krikaat`ikaa - 1 There are 900 Snaayus explained by Sus`hrutaachaarya. They are differentiated in 4 types. Prataanavati Vritta Prithula Sushira But those to be included in the Madhyama Maarga are the Prataanavati and the Vritta Snaayu i.e. Kand`araa. They are the one, which cover the Asthisandhi and hence as per the definition are to be included in the Madhyama Rogamaarga. Now we will see the importance of Marma with reference to the Madhyama Maarga. There are 107 Marma_s in the body and are categorized according to their anatomical structure and effects caused due to trauma on them. The Praan`a reside specifically at the site of Marma hence any injury or disease occurring at the Marma site is exceedingly troublesome and difficult to cure due to the intricateness of the anatomical structure. The Praan`a are soma Marut, Tej, Satva, Raja, Tama and the Jivaatmaa. The main three Marmas that are given the utmost Importance in the Madhyama Maarga are S`hira, Hridaya, Basti. Now if we recollect both the Hridaya (heart) and the Basti (urinary bladder) have been included in the Kosht`ha Maarga. It is due to the structural formation of those organs but as per the importance of the structures and predominant presence of Praan`a in these organs they are specifically included in the Madhyama Maarga. These three are the most important triad of the body. The S`haakhaa Marma are dependent on the Skandha Marma and the Skandha Marma in turn are dependent on the Trimarma for their existence. This concept is explained by Ayurveda by saying if the Aas`hraya i.e. the base is destroyed, the Aas`hrita i.e. the structure dependent on this base, will also be destroyed. Hence the Trividha Marma are to be protected with extreme precaution from outside trauma and internal Vaataadi Dosha. Now that we have seen the structures included in the Madhyama Maarga, let us look at the diseases occurring in the Madhyama Maarga. They are: Pakshavadha Graha Apataanaka Ardita S`hosha Raajayakshmaa Asthisandhis`hoola Gudabhrams`ha S`hiroroga Bastiroga Hridaya Roga These Three Rogamaarga_s have been described, so as to understand the pathogenesis of the disease. The movement of the Dosha from one Maarga to another and the result of this movement have on the Saadhyaasaadhytva i.e. the curability of the disease needs to be studied. The diseases occurring in one Maarga are usually Sukhasaadhya or easily curable. The spread of the disease from one Maarga to the other Maarga, denotes the increase in the vitiation of the Dosha. The increase in the amount of the Dosha causes the Dosha to spread from one Maarga to the other. The movement of the Dosha from the S`haakhaa Maarga to the Kosht`ha Maarga is the natural movement of the Dosha or the Praakrita Gati. The reasons for this Gati are: Increase in the Dosha amount Liquefaction of the Dosha Paachana of the Dosha Vaayu Nigraha Control of Vaayu Due to the increase in the amount of Dosha present in the S`haakhaa, it moves towards the Kosht`ha as it cannot be accommodated in the S`haakhaa just like overflow of water during floods. The liquefaction of Dosha causes the transfer of the Dosha to the Kosht`ha from S`haakhaa. The Paachana or digestion of Dosha here actually means separation of the set Dosha, which will stimulate the flow of the Dosha to the Kosht`ha. The control over Vaayu causes the healthy functioning of the body by bringing the Dosha into the Kosht`ha. These principles are used specially during S`hodhana Chikitsaa or the purification methods i.e. emesis, Vamana, Virechana-purgation, Niruhabasti and S`hirovirechana. The Dosha present in the S`haakhaa and causing different diseases are softened by taking, Snehapaana-Oleation therapy for a prescribed period of time. Then they are liquefied and separated by the Svedana fomentation therapy. After this the medicines are administered which cause the surge of the Dosha from the S`haakhaa to the Kosht`ha and successively help to purge it out of the body. This pattern of Dosha is the treatment pattern and the natural pattern of the Dosha_s as the body maintains its homeostasis. But when the action of the Dosha is the other way round it is disease formative or disease aggravating. The movement of the Dosha from Kosht`ha to the S`haakhaa causes disease. The factors precipitating this movement are as follows: Excessive exercise Excessive intensity of heat Consumption of unhealthy food Increased speed of Vaayu The intensity of heat liquefies the Dosha and hence causes them to move from the Kosht`ha to the S`haakhaa. Consumption of food, which is described as unhealthy by Ayurveda like Viruddhaahaara-incompatible diet, excessively spicy, hot stale food, are all stimulant factors for movement of the Dosha to the S`haakhaa from the Kosht`ha. The speed of Vaayu when not in a healthy condition i.e. vitiated Vaayu causes the Dosha movement from Kosht`ha to the s`haakhaa. The disease formation of cure mainly depends on the condition of the Dosha. The purpose of putting the different structures together is called Rogamaarga and then segregating them wisely into three main types was to be able to comprehend the pattern of disease formation and avoid the factors responsible for precipitating the disease in the body. The diseases occurring in the S`haakhaa Maarga and Kosht`ha Maarga are easier to cure as compared to the diseases occurring in the Madhyama Maarga. In the S`haakhaa Maarga the Dosha_s are brought from the S`haakhaa to the Kosht`ha and then purged out of the body through the nearest orifice. Though exercising is healthy, anything done in excess is always unhealthy. One should exercise only of ones capacity in the colder seasons and even less in the other seasons. The symptoms of -capacity exercise depends on sweat formation in the armpits, overhead and chest, increased respiratory rate and a feeling of lightness. Calculation of these symptoms, help us to exercise in the right amount. Excessive exercising causes Kshobha or stress in the body. In any stress, the digestive function of the body is hampered. This is due to withholding the activities of the body to regain an unstressed condition for homeostasis. This leads to the movement of the Dosha from Kosht`ha back to S`haakhaa. The Dosha come to the Kosht`ha for fulfillment of their functions of digestion metabolism at different levels. But due to stress they return to the S`haakhaa. Repeated return of unutilized Dosha back to the S`haakhaa causes Sanchaya or collection of the Dosha in the S`haakhaa itself. This cleansing process helps control the disease permanently. The diseases occurring in the Madhyama Maarga are termed as Krichchhra Saadhya. This is due to the intricacy of the structure of this Maarga_s, all the vital points i.e. the Marma are included in this Maarga. For medicine to reach this Maarga and act on the disease it has to be wisely thought because it should not harm the vital points (Marma). For this the Aachaarya_s have suggested the Basti treatment. This treatment works on the whole body but more precisely on the Vaata Dosha, which is responsible for all movements of Dosha in the body. Also it has the Sookshma quality, which helps to penetrate through minute structures and carries the medicinal properties of Basti along with it and acts on the diseases occurring in the Madhyama Maarga and S`haakhaa Maarga and Kosht`ha Maarga also. By studying the different Rogamaarga_s and the movement of the Dosha from one Maarga to other it becomes easier to realize the disease formation process. This in turn helps the Vaidya devise a specific treatment or plan as per the Maarga. Specificity in treatment helps recovery faster and easier.

Types  S. Chi. 23 S`hotha is of 6 types as per the body part on which it manifests (Avayava Samuttha / Ekaangaja S`hotha) S`hotha which appears on whole body is Sarvasara (Sarvaangaja S`hotha) It is of 5 types Types  A. H. Ni.13 Sampraapti: 1. Aggravated Vaayu vitiates Kapha, Rakta, Pitta after entering in to the peripheral vessels (Baahya Siraa). As a result, the passage gets obstructed which spreads nearby causing swelling (Utsedha). This is S`hotha. Swelling is the invariable characteristic feature of S`hotha. If Dosha, afflict chest (Oordhva Sthaana), then the swelling appears at the upper body. If Dosha afflict lower part of the body, which is the location of Vaayu, then swelling appears in the lower body part. If this affliction take place in to the middle part of the body (between chest and the pelvic region / Basti), then swelling occurs in the middle part of the body. If this affliction occurs all over the body then the swelling appears all over the physique. If however, these afflictions take place in the specific areas, then the swelling appears locally and it is designated after the name of the body part where it occurs.E.g. Gala S`hotha. 2. Due to the aggravating factors, Dosha get aggravated. These Dosha in turn vitiate Dhaatu and S`hotha (S`hvayathu) gets manifested all over the body. 3. Dosha situated in the Aamaas`haya produces S`hotha at the upper side of the body; when situated in the Pakvaas`haya, S`hotha manifested on middle of the body When these Dosha are situated in the Varchasthaana, S`hotha manifests on the lower body Whereas, Dosha situated in the whole body cause S`hotha all over the body It is Sarvasara. 4. Vitiated Vaayu vitiates Pitta, Rakta, Kapha traversing them to peripheral vessels (Bahih Siraa). These Dosha settle down in to Tvak and Maamsa as Vaayu is obstructed by Pitta, Rakta and Kapha. (Arun`a Datta A. H. Ni.13/21) A body part at which this pathogenesis happens, nearby this stable, immovable swelling gets appeared. This is S`hotha due to all the three Dosha. Aggravated Vaayu due to its increasing factors, vitiates Tvak, Maamsa and S`hon`ita, then generates S`hotha. Pittaja S`hotha Pitta aggravated due to its increasing factors, vitiates Tvak, Maamsa and S`hon`ita then generates S`hotha. Kapha aggravated due to its aggravating factors, vitiates Tvak, Maamsa and S`hon`ita then generates S`hotha. By combinations of Vaataja, Pittaja and Kaphaja S`hotha, Dvandvaja and Saannipaatika type of S`hotha are manifested. The causative factors, signs and symptoms are same for S`hotha formed of respective Dosha. Thus, by considering all the combinations of Dosha in S`hotha, 7 types of S`hotha are manifested. The swelling which started of the feet and spreads all over the body in male, that which starts of face and spreads all over the body in female, and that which starts of perineum (Guhya Sthaana) in both male and female is very difficult to cure. Also, S`hotha which has manifested with complications (Upadrava) is difficult to cure. Carakaachaarya has mentioned some conditions as separate Vyaadhi under the S`hotha chapter, as listed below: 1. Upajhvikaa If the aggravated Kapha harbours at the root of the tongue, it causes immediate swelling. 2. Galas`hun`d`kaa If the aggravated Kapha harbours at the Kaakala (Taalu Moola Chakrapaan`i), it causes immediate swelling. 3. Galagan`d`a If the aggravated Kapha gets located at the outside of the throat, it causes swelling slowly. 4. Galagraha If the aggravated Kapha gets located at the inside of the throat, it causes immediate swelling. 5. Visarpa When the aggravated Pitta together with Rakta spreads within the skin, it causes red swelling called as Visarpa. 6. Pid`akaa When the aggravated Pitta is located in the Tvak (skin) and  Rakta, this causes red swelling which is called as Pid`akaa. 7. Tilakaa / Piplu / Vyamga / Neelikaa When the aggravated Pitta gets dried up after reaching to the Rakta, it causes Tilakaa (Black Moles) / Piplu (Port wine mark) / Vyamga (Red Moles) / Neelikaa (Blue Moles). 8. S`hamkhaka In the temporal region when aggravated Pitta gets located in, the serous swelling caused is known as S`hankhaka. 9. Karn`amoola S`hotha When aggravated Pitta resides at the root of the ear (Karn`a Moola), especially after fever (Jvara), it causes swelling which is difficult to cure and leads to death. 10. Pleehaa Vriddhi When aggravated Vaayu disturbs the Pleehaa (Spleen), and slowly causes pain in the flanks which leads to the enlargement of the Spleen (Pleehaa Vridddhi) 11. Gulma When aggravated Vaayu resides in the sites at which Gulma is manifested (Naabhi, 2 Paars`hva, Hridaya, Basti), it produces S`hotha with pain is Gulma. 12.

Taalu Vidradhi All the three aggravated Dosha at the palate region (Taalu) produce an abscess with burning sensation, redness and suppuration, this is Taalu Vidradhi. 5. Upajihvikaa This is a swelling at exterior of the tongue on the upper side of tongue. This is due to vitiation of Kapha. 6. Adhijihvikaa This is a swelling at the lower side of the tongue. This is due to vitiation of Kapha. 7. Upakus`ha Because of the aggravation of Pitta and Rakta, there is swelling in the gums (Danta Maamsa) which is called as Upakus`ha. 8. Danta Vidradhi Accumulated Kapha and Rakta both cause swelling in the Danta Maamsa (gums). It is Danta Vidradhi. 9. Galagan`d`a If there is a single swelling in the side of neck then it is Galagan`d`a. 10. Gan`d`amaalaa If there is a chain of the swellings at the side of the neck then it is Gan`d`amaalaa. Both Galagan`d`a and Gan`d`amaalaa are curable. But if they are associated with Peenasa, Paars`hvas`hoola, Kaasa, Jvara, Chchhardi then they become incurable. 11.

As the channels are covered by the Medas; other Dhaatu cannot be nourished. Only Medas gets nourished. This results in the debility to perform physical acts. Medas gets accumulated on the abdomen. The abdomen gets enlarged in a person. As Vaata is covered by Medas (Medaavrita Vaata), it traverses in the Kosht`ha and increases Agni (Agni Sandhukshan`a).

Kapha gets fried up resulting in Trishn`aa. The peculiar symptom of Kaphajaa Trishn`aa is oedema on the limbs. According to Vaagbhat`a, aggravated Kapha obstructs Vaata in Udakavaha Srotas.

When this Aahaara Rasa is depleted, the water content in the body also gets depleted and a person becomes thirsty. Due to depletion of Rasa Dhaatu, a person is desiccated and suffers from burning sensation. He demands for more and more water. According to some, Kshayajaa Trishn`aa is caused due to Sannipaata.

These examinations are of various types as follows: Clinical Examination Examination of Disease: For thorough investigation of disease five types of information is needed. It is called as Nidaana Panchaka. Nidaana Panchaka consists of five tools for diagnosing a disease. They are Hetu (Information about Causative Factors), Poorvaroopa (Prodromal signs & symptoms), Roopa (Signs & symptoms), Sampraapti (Pathogenesis) and Upas`haya-Anupas`haya (Relieving or aggravating factors from food, drud and / or regimen). Hetu: Hetu means causative factor. Nimitta, Aayatana, Pratyaya, Utthaana, Kaaran`a and Nidaana are synonyms of Hetu. These are initiators of a disease. Actual disease development process starts afterwards. To understand effect, role etc. of Hetu in disease development, they are classified into various types as follows: Type of Hetu Poorvaroopa: Means prodromal signs and symptoms. These are symptoms or indications of the imending disease. Before the actual onset of the disease some symptoms develop and they give clues about the forthcoming disease. Such symptoms are called as Poorvaroopa. There are two types of Poorvaroopa viz. Saamaanya (General) and Vis`hesha (Specific) Poorvaroopa. Saamaanya (General) Poorvaroopa: The symptoms which give a clue regarding the forthcoming diasease without giving an idea of predominant Dosha due to which particular symptoms occur is called as Saamaanya Poorvaroopa. E.g. Arati, Aruchi, Jrimbhaa etc. are Saamaanya Poorvaroopa of Jvara. Vis`hesha (Specific) Poorvaroopa: The symptoms which give a clue regarding the forthcoming diasease at the same time giving an idea of the predominant vitiated Dosha due to which particular symptoms occur is called as Vis`hesha Poorvaroopa e.g Angamarda, Jrimbhaa are Vis`hesha Poorvaroopa of Vaataja Jvara. Roopa: Means signs and symptoms of actual manifestation of disease. This is a group of signs and symptoms, which develop after the pathogenesis of disease e.g. Aruchi, Klama and Tiktodgaara etc., are Roopa of Amlapitta. By knowing Roopa physician get more clear idea about disease. Sampraapti: Means pathogenesis of disease. The process of pathogenesis from Hetu Sevana till the manifestation of the disease is called Sampraapti .All the stages from the very contact of the body with etiological factor to the development of disease are called as Sampraapti. Ehnce it is a dynamic process. Thorough understanding of Sampraapti is very essential for deciding appropriate line of treatment. To understand pathogenesis of disease Sampraapti is divided in to five types i.e. Sankhyaa Sampraapti classification according to main types of disease Vikalpa Sampraapti statement or identification of the Dosha subtype Praadhaanya Sampraapti statement of principal and the secondary Dosha Bala Sampraapti classification according to the strength of participating Dosha Kaala Sampraapti classification of pathogenesis according to time of onset and progress Upas`haya-Anupas`haya: For diagnosing disease, specific group of signs and symptoms are essential. But if the symptoms are feeble / masked or not well marked then physician has to adopt a trial and error method which is called as Upas`haya-Anupas`haya. Using this method physician can diagnose or differentiate disease or disease condition. It is one of the procedures to diagnose the involvement of Dosha e.g. hot water poured over the paining joint of a person so as to reduce the intensity of pain. It indicates the involvement of Vaata Dosha. Upas`haya: A judicial use of drug, diet and regimen to relieve the disease symptoms is Upas`haya, the palliating factors. Suitable remedies, food articles and / or regimen those allay the disease from which the diagnosis can be made are known as Upas`haya. These are specific factors, which pacify the symptoms of a disease e.g. Pratamaka S`hvaasa relived due to cold wheather, food (mainly due to diet and lifestyle which has dominant cold attribute.). Anupas`haya: These are the precipitating factors. They are a help in diagnosing a condition, which has masked symptoms. The entity viz. drug, diet or regimen, which aggravates the symptoms of disease, is called Anupas`haya. It is also a tool for diagnosis like Upas`haya. It has exactly opposite characteristic of Upas`haya e.g. Tamaka S`hvaasa agreevated due to cold wheather, food. (Mainly due to diet and lifestyle which has dominant cold attribute). It is an important tool to diagnose a condition with masked symptomatology. It is classified in various ways as enumerated below: Examination of Patient: It comprises of Trividha Pareekshaa, Asht`avidha Pareekshaa and Das`havidha Pareekshaa. Trividha Pareekshaa: It consist of three fold examination i.e Dars`hana, Spars`ha and Pras`hn`a Darsh`ana: Dars`hana means observation / inspection. It is most important and authentic examination. Physician can observe color, secretions, oedema, infection, tumour etc. using Darshan`a Pareekshaa. Spars`ha: Spars`hana means palpation. It is useful for finding spleenomegaly, hepatomegaly, texture of skin etc. Pras`hn`a: Pras`hna means interrogation. For getting information about origin, progress, duration, nature etc. of symptoms and the disease physician has to ask various questions to patients. All such interrogation comes under this examination. Asht`avidha Pareekshaa:- Asht`avidha Pareeksha provides a clear picture of nature of ailment and patient's internal environment. It involves the examination of pulse (Naad`ee), tongue (Jihvaa), voice (S`habda), skin (Tvak), eye (Netra), general appearance (Aakriti), urine (Mootra) & stool (Mala). Naad`ee Pareekshaa: It is examination of pulse. An experienced Ayurvedic physician can assess the individual constitution, pathological state (Vikriti), imbalances of Dosha, very subtle observations and even prognosis of disease through the pulse. The ideal time for pulse examination is early morning on empty stomach. But in case of emergency, it can be examined at any time of the day or night. Following characteristics of Naad`ee are observed in examination: Asaadhya Chapala D`amaru Deergha Drita Gambheera Gati Hamsa Gati Kampa Kaphaja Ksheen`a Laghu Man`d`ooka Gati Manda Pittaja S`heeta S`hithila Saannipaatika Sarala Sarpa Gati Snigdha Sookshma Spanda Sthira Tiryak Ushn`a Vaataja Vakra Vegavatee Vyaakula S`habda Pareekshaa: It is examination of voice. Dosha affect the natural voice of an individual. Normal voice of the person is expected to be examined in Prakriti and Saarataa application and the altered voice in ill health is expected to be examined in S`habda Pareekshaa. Following characteristics of voice observed in S`habda Pareekshaa: Bhinna Kaansyatulya Svara Bhinna Svara Jarjara Svara Kshaama Svara Saanunaasika Svara Sakta Svara Sanna Svara Svara Graha Svara Haani Svara Kshaya Svara Raukshya Svara Saada Svara Vikritatva Svarabheda Vaisvarya S`heeghra Vaak Vaak Jad`atva Vaak Krichchratva Vaak Paarushya Spars`ha Pareekshaa: It is also known as palpation. Palpation is an important clinical method for examination of skin and organs underneath. The examination helps to identify the Dosha responsible for the sign as well as severity of the disease / pain etc. Following characteristics of skin observed in Spars`ha Pareekshaa: S`heetaspars`hayuktaTvak Spars`haadnyaanam Spars`haasahatva Kharaspars`hee Tvak S`heetaspars`hayuktaTvak Chala-Achala Granthi S`heetaspars`hayukta Granthi Spars`haasahatva (Sthaana:- Kan`t`ha) Spars`haasahatva (Sthaana:- Ars`ha) Spars`haasahatva (Sthaana:- Paada) Spars`haadynaanam (Sthaana:- Adhah Kaaya) Spars`ha Haani (Sthaana:- Med`hra) Spars`haasahatva (Sthaana:- Yoni) Spars`haasahatva (Sthaana:- Netra) Ars`haspars`ha Preeti S`habda Asthni (Spars`hamaane) Spars`ha Sahatva (Sthaana:- Ars`ha) Kharaspars`hee Kes`ha Spars`haabhilaashaa Parusha Spars`ha (Sthaana:- Mukha) S`heetaspars`ha Adnyaana (Sthaana:- Paada) Spars`haasahatva (Sthaana:- S`hira) Spars`haasahatva (Sthaana:- Sandhi) Spars`haasahatva (Sthaana:- Ura) Drik Pareekshaa: It is examination of eye of an individual. Dosha affect the eyes of an individual. Normal eyes of the person are expected to be examined in Prakriti and Saarataa application and the altered colour or appearance in ill health is expected to examine in this field e.g. In jaundice colour of sclera becomes yellow, in Arjuna a disease of eye it becomes red etc. Following characteristics ( Colour, Vision etc.) of eye observed in Netra Pareekshaa: Varn`a:- Taamra, S`hveta, Rakta etc. Sraava:- Raktavarn`ee, S`hveta, Ghana etc. Adhesions:- Granthi, Arbuda, Pid`akaa, S`hotha, Maamsaankura etc. Svaroopa: Paans`hupoorn`asadris`ha Netra, Yakritpin`d`asadris`ha Netra Vision: Adhah Drisht`i Chhatrasadris`ha Drisht`i Dagdhasadris`ha Drisht`i Drisht`i Kalushatva Drisht`i Naas`ha Drisht`i Saada Drisht`i Sankocha Drisht`i Stambha Hrasva Drisht`i Ksheen`a Drisht`i Oordhva Drisht`i Aakriti Pareekshaa: Aakriti is also known as general appearance of the patient. In many of diseases body looses its natural appearance, shape or form by which the disease can be identified e.g. in Haleemaka disease the patient looks like a frog (Bhekaabha), in Krosht`ukas`heersha knee joint appears like head of jackal.

Tongue examination is important for assessing status of gastrointestinal tract. Following characteristics of tongue observed in Jihvaa Pareekshaa: Varn`a(Colour): Peeta, S`hyaava, Krishn`a, Other: Saama Niraama Kan`t`akayukta Maamsaankurayukt, Sphut`ita S`hotha(Oordva Bhaage) S`hotha (Adho Bhaage), S`haatana Bahinissran`a Antasaran`a c) Das`havidha Rugn`a Pareekshaa:- This is set of ten parameters aimed at evaluating the individual for diagnosis and then assessing selected Dravya, Kalpa, Aahaara for compatibility for management. They are S`haareera Prakriti: Prakriti is the Ayurvedic profile or unique psychosomatic temperament of an individual, encompassing his or her physical, functional and behavioural characteristics determined at the time of conception. The varying proportions of Kapha, Pitta and Vaata Dosha determining the S`haareera Prakriti i.e. in the body type play a pivotal role. A body type is also termed as Personal Disposition or Physical Constitution. Types of Prakriti: Types of Dosha Prakriti a. Vaatapradhaana b. Pittapradhaana c. Kaphapradhaana d. Vaatapradhaana Pittaanubandhi e. Pittapradhaana Vaataanubandhi f. Kaphapradhaana Vaataanubandhi g. Vaatapradhaana Kaphaanubandhi h. Pittapradhaana Kaphaanubandhi i. Kaphapradhaana Pittaanubandhi j. Samaprakriti Maanasa Prakriti: It is described as psychological traits. This influences the individuals life style, his response pattern to a stimulus and thus the health too. Depending upon the nature these are categorized as Sattvapradhaana, Rajapradhaana and Tamapradhaana. Depending on these traits physician can guess the psychological health as well as behaviours in diseased condition. Physician can also judge the severity of signs and symptoms severity on the grounds of Maanasa Prakriti. Types of Maanasa Prakriti a. Sattvapradhaana b. Rajahpradhaana c. Tamahpradhaana Vikriti: Means transformed, altered, changed; deformed, disfigured and unnatural (M.W.) It should be examined by Hetu, Dosha, Dushya, Prakriti, Des`ha, Kaala, Bala, Hetu Bala, Lakshan`a Bala etc. to understand prognosis of disease. Dhaatusaarataa: Dhaatu means body constituents. These are seven in number and their qualitative assessment can be performed by Saarataa Pareekshan`a. Saara is the essence of that particular constituent. It reflects on various body parts in a positive manner by which it is assessed e.g. positive sign related to particular part indicates Saarataa of related constituent and absence of these signs indicate Asaarataa (devoid of Saarataa) of the same constituent. In Madhya Saarataa signs of both Saarataa and Asaarataa are present. Physician can also judge the signs and symptoms severity as well as prognosis of the disease on the grounds of Saarataa. Types of Saarataa are a. Rasa Saara or Rasa-Asaara b. Rakta Saara or Rakta-Asaara c. Maamsa Saara or Maamsa-Asaara d. Majjaa Saara or Majjaa-Asaara e. Asthi Saara or Asthi-Asaara f. Meda Saara or Meda-Asaara g. S`hukra Saara or S`hukra-Asaara h. Sarva Saara or Sarva-Asaara i. Sattva Saara or Sattva-Asaara Samhanana: Examination of compactness or firmness of the body is called as Samhanana Pareekshaa. Samhanana is one of the parameters to know the Bala (strength) of an individual. E.g. Pravara Samhanana implies good strength, Madhyama Samhanana implies medium strength and Avara Samhanana implies low strength. (It is the evaluation of Muscle power for this parameter.) Samhanana is mainly about Maamsa not bones, joints and ligaments; the individual should examine the tone, firmness of musculature and not density of bones. The parameters for this examination are: - Examination of bones: - for symmetry (Sama) and well separation or distribution (Suvibhakta). Examination of joints: - for firm closure or covering by ligaments. Examination of Flesh and Blood: - for well situation / condition. Aahaaras`hakti: It is defined as capacity of consumption and power of digestion of diet taken through out the day all together. Amount of intake of individual articles and all taken together is an indicator of Agnibala / Aahaaras`hakti. Time taken for digesting the ingested food is an indicator of Agnibala / Aahaaras`hakti. If both the capacities are good, Aahaaras`hakti is considered as Pravara (high), if these are medium Aahaaras`hakti is considered as Madhyama (moderate), and if these are poor Aahaaras`hakti is considered as Avara (low). Physical Strength (Bala) and life span (Ayu) is dependant of Aahaaras`hakti. Hence its assessment is important. Vyaayaamas`hakti: Any desired strenuous physical activity which results in increase in physical power and efficiency is Vyaayaama (exercise). During exercise appearance of sweat over forehead, armpits, joints and over nose and a need to breathe through mouth are the signs of half physical strength (Ardha S`hakti Vyaayaama). From this Vyaayaamas`hakti of an individual can be assessed. The time taken by the individual to reach the Ardha S`hakti is to be noted on first visit and on subsequent visits to note the Upas`haya / Anupas`haya of the management. You are allowed to use your parameters to calculate it and expected to select the related result from the list provided in this field as Pravara (high), Madhyama (moderate) or Avara (low). Saatmya: Saatmya are those stimuli which are homologous to the internal environment and do not generate an adverse reaction in an individual, this is decided at the time of Prakriti formation. This is termed as Sahaja Saatmya while there are certain habits a person acquires during his life span; they also do not generate adverse reaction after being accustomed to them. These are termed as Oka / Abhyaasa Saatmya. Mostly it is related to food items such as ghee, milk, oil and meat soup and six basic tastes (sweet, sour, salty, pungent, bitter and astringent) of the food. If an individual can consume all the above mentioned substances without any adverse reaction in the body, its Saatmya is considered as high (Pravara). If an individual can consume some of the above mentioned substances without any adverse reaction in the body, its Saatmya is considered as moderate (Madhyama). If an individual can consume dry substances and only one taste of the six without any adverse reaction in the body, its Saatmya is considered as low (Avara). Saatmya is directly proportional to strength (Bala), capacity to tolerate pain (Kles`hasahatva) and longevity. Asaatmya: Any stimulus that elicits an adverse reaction in the internal environment, sense organs, mind and the soul or any of them is Asaatmya e.g. Asaatmya of particular substance like milk products, non-vegetarian food etc. Sattva: Sattva refers to the mental state, which controls the body in collaboration with the soul. Depending on degree of mental strength, it is considered to be Pravara (high), Madhyama (moderate) or Avara (low). Pravara Sattva is Sattva Saara. A person when capable of rationalising the situation he is in; in an objective manner and does not need any support moral or otherwise to face the situation is of Pravara Sattva. A person who can withstand the adverse situation on being consoled and cheered by others is of Madhyama Sattva. A person who cannot bear any change in the situation pleasurable or painful and who lacks the capacity to rationalise is possessed of Avara Sattva. Examination of Sattva is important for understanding his response to the condition he is in: in ill health as well as to judge the severity of the signs and symptoms for deciding the prognosis. (For details see C.Vi. 8/119) Pramaan`a Pareekshaa: In healthy individuals the normal proportions (Anthropometric measurements) of all body parts in terms of Anguli measurement are mentioned in classical texts. This examination is significant from the point of view of immunity and longevity. E.g. Vaya: Various conditions of body which depends upon Kaala and Praamaan`a are called as Vaya. It is mainly divided in to three parts Disease prognosis, line of treatment depends upon age of the patient. Importance of Das`havidha Pareekshaa: Selection of medicine is dependent upon Samhanana, Aahaaras`hakti, Vyaayaams`hakti, Saatmya, Sattva and Vaya of patient and condition of involved Dosha. e.g. Thus Nidaana Panchaka, Asht`vidha Pareekshaa and Das`havidha Pareekshaa are three pillars of clinical examination.

This aggravated Vata moves through the abdomen, suppressing digestion and stimulating Kapha, causing swelling.\n\nPittaja Udara is caused by an aggravation of the Pitta dosha, which obstructs the channels of Vata and Kapha. It moves upward and suppresses digestion, leading to Udara.\n\nKaphaja Udara is caused by an aggravation of the Kapha dosha, which obstructs the channels of circulation, trapping Vata outside the intestines. This pressure on Kapha leads to Udara.\n\nSannipaata Udara is caused by an aggravation of all three doshas, which accumulate in the digestive system and vitiate the blood, leading to Udara.\n\nIn addition to these four main types, there are also two other types of Udara: Pleehodara and Baddha Gudodara. Pleehodara is caused by an enlargement of the spleen, while Baddha Gudodara is caused by an obstruction in the passage of feces.", "is_summary_swapped": false}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["tag", "file_path", "file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "20cea03c-be82-4c39-82e8-3b9ff66a2146", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/dai/rag/data/clean_html/Articles/Nidaana/Udara.htm", "file_name": "Udara.htm", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 16417, "creation_date": "2024-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-14", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-15"}, "hash": "5efdc64386ddc5d9118693c1b84362b76bbf96b6f6d006af98cf31b08a078d95", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Udara Reference: Ch.Chi.13, A.H.Ni.12, Su.Ni.7 Introduction The disease is called as Udara because there is distension of Udara (Abdomen). Svaroopa Distended abdomen is the cardinal sign of the disease (Aadhmaata Udara and Kukshi). It is a sort of edema and therefore Chakrapaan`i says that it has been described after S`hotha. Udara is a serious type of disease (Ghora  Krichchhratama). Patient looks as if he is dead; it reveals the serious condition of the disease. Nirukti Udara Utsedha Saamaanyaat Udaram | M. N. 35 Madhukos`ha Synonyms Jat`hara Hetu The basic factor in manifestation of Udara is Agni Dosha. In context of Udara, Agni Dosha refers to Agni Maandya (lowered digestive capacity); which lead to the aggravation of Dosha and Mala (Mala Vriddhi Malaah Vaataadayah Pureeshaadayah Cha - Chakrapaan`i). This increased quantity of Mala leads to Udara. In such a condition of lowered digestive capacity, a person eats dirty food; Dosha get accumulated due to indigestion. There is vitiation of Praan`a Vaayu, Apaana Vaayu and digestive power (Agni). There is obstruction of upward and downward channel (Praan`avaha and Pureeshavaha Srotas). This results in to the distention of abdomen and flanks which is a cardinal sign of Udara. Different types of Udara are caused by the following factors: Because of these factors, different types of Udara are manifested in those persons having lowered digestive capacity (Mandaagni). Sampraapti  Sus`hruta describes mode of manifestation of Udara according to Upasnehana Nyaaya.  Signs and symptoms of Udara It presents itself with the symptoms resembling Gulma. But still it is different form Gulma. Actually, before complete manifestation of Udara, the picture of disease resembles to Gulma. Cardinal signs Other signs: presentation of a patient who is suffering from Udara is like this: Types of Udara Vaataja Udara Vaayu gets aggravated due to dry food and less quantity of food, exertion, suppression of natural urges, Udaavarta (upward movement of the Vaayu) and emaciation. This aggravated Vaayu moves through Kukshi, Hridaya, Basti and Guda suppressing digestive capacity (Agni Hanana). It stimulates Kapha (Kapham Uddhooya), therefore movements of Vaayu gets arrested between skin and muscular tissue of the abdomen which causes swelling of the abdomen.  Pittaja Udara Pitta gets immediately accumulated due to Pitta aggravating factors. Having reached to the locations of Vaayu and Kapha, it obstructs their channels. It moves upward and suppresses the Agni in the stomach as a result of which Udara gets manifested. Kaphaja Udara Kapha gets aggravated due to Kapha aggravating factors. This aggravated Kapha obstructs the channels of the circulation; as a result of which Vaayu gets obstructed located in the exterior of the intestines (Bahih Antragah). This Vaayu exercises pressure on Kapha as a result of which Udara is manifested. Sannipaata Udara All the three Dosha get aggravated due to their aggravating causes such as These three Dosha get accumulated gradually in the Kosht`ha (digestive system) also Rakta gets vitiated. as a result of which Udara gets manifested.  This type of Udara gets aggravated due to cold air, in cloudy weather. Patient faints down, becomes pale, emaciates, and becomes thirsty. This is serious condition. Pleehaa Udara Person who is indulged in excessive exertion, traveling, excessive movements, excessive sexual act, carrying heavy load, walking, and emesis after eating, Pleehaa (Spleen), which is situated in the left side of the abdomen gets displaced and enlarged. It Spleen can get enlarged (without displacement) due to the increase in the quantity of blood. Increase in blood is possible due to increase in the antecedent Dhaatu like Rasa and increase in the descendent Dhaatu like Maamsa etc. The enlarged Pleehaa resembles to the Asht`heelaa  rounded, stony hard swelling (like back of tortoise). It goes on increasing and if at all it remains untreated, it puts the pressure on the flanks, stomach (Jat`hara) and site of Agni manifesting Udara. The same event may take place with respect to Yakrit (Liver). Pleehaa Roga has similar Sampraapti that of Pleehodara and has signs and symptoms as Pleehaa Vriddhi and Paars`hva Toda. If liver gets enlarged then it is called as Yakritodara. It is counted in Pleehodara itself.  Sampraapti Suggested by Sus`hruta When a person indulges in Vidaahee and Abhishyandee food, Rakta and Kapha gets highly vitiated. They enlarge Pleehaa and the Agni gets lowered. Patient has mild temperature (Manda Jvara), emaciated and highly paled (AtiPaan`d`u). Baddha Gudodara Vaayu gets aggravated as a result of obstruction in the passage of the Guda because of following: Intake of foreign bodies (as small hairs with food) Udaavarta (Upward movement of Vaayu) Upalepa (coating of intestines due to stickiness in the food etc) Piles (Ars`ha), Antra Sammoorchchaanaa (intussusceptions or intrusion of the intestine in to its lumen) Obstruction to the passage of Apaana Vaayu. This aggravated Vaayu lowers down the digestive capacity (Agnim Hatvaa). It obstructs movements of faces, Pitta and Kapha. Abdominal swelling caused by the obstruction in the intestines gets manifested that is termed as Baddha Gudodara. This results in distention of the region between Hridaya and Naabhi. Kshata Udara The intestines get perforated because of the following reasons: The wound in the intestine thus caused gets suppurated and from this wound the Rasa comes of the intestines. The rectum and the intestines get filled with this juice as a result of which Kshata Udara (Acute abdominal swelling due to intestinal perforation) is manifested. Difference between Udakodara and Kshata Udara. It may present similar to Udakodara; but in comparison with Udakodara, manifestation of Kshata Udara is quicker than Udakodara. Parisraavee Udara / Kshataantra Any foreign body (S`halya) engulfed with food cuts down the intestines. Secretions through this wound gets accumulated below the level of umbilicus. The fluid gets passed through the anus. Therefore, there is distention of the abdomen below umbilical level with pain and burning sensation (Vidahyate). Udakodara Causes of Udakodara include Agnimaandya potentiating factors, also following causes are prominent: When emaciated, weakened person or whose digestive capacity is hampered, consumes Sneha (oily substances) that leads to complete loss of digestive capacity. When a person drinks cold water after consumption of Sneha, Anuvaasana Basti, Vamana (Emesis), Virechana (Purgation), Niruha Basti. Factors, which block channels by Sneha. As a result of this Vaayu located in Kloman gets mixed with Kapha and Udaka. They obstruct the channels resulting in the increase of Udaka (body fluid). The vitiated Vaayu and Kapha from their locations assist in increasing this water as a result of which Udakodara is caused. Physician should treat this condition immediately before any complication gets appeared and before fluid gets accumulated in the abdomen. If it is not treated, then the vitiated Dosha get displaced and become liquefied due to Paripaaka (Maturation). They produce stickiness in the Sandhi and channels (Srotas). Sweat is diverted from the external channels in to the side ways (Tiryag Gati) which adds to the quantity of fluid accumulated in the abdomen. Clinical presentation of Udakodara: The appearance of this sticky liquid (Pichchhaa) makes the abdomen round (Man`d`alam), heavy (Guru) and numb (Stimita). The abdomen becomes dull in percussion (Aakot`hita S`habdam) and soft to touch (Mridu Spars`ham). Thereafter, the veins on the abdomen disappear. During this period, the umbilical region is primarily afflicted and from there the disease spreads in the remaining parts of the abdomen. The abdomen looks like a bag of leather full of water with averted umbilicus.

This is cardinal sign of Unmaada. In Unmaada there is unsteadiness in Dhee, Vidnyaana and Smriti. A person does not have good or bad feelings about favourable or unfavourable conditions. He keeps wandering like a chariot without charioteer. His activities are without any intention. Mythology Unmaada was observed in the spiritual rite carried out by Daksha Prajaapati after the occurrence of Kusht`ha. Nirukti 1. Samudbhramam Buddhimanahsmriteenaam Unmaadam Aagantu Nijottham Aahuh | Ch. Chi. 9/8 Mano Vibhrama (perversion of mind) is nothing but a state in which the person thinks of things which he would never have thought of otherwise. This Mano Vibhrama includes perversion in the entities like Smriti etc. explained in Nidaana Sthaana in Charaka Samhitaa. 2. Madayanti Uddha (dga) taa Doshaah Yasmaad Unmaargam Aas`hritaah | Maanaso Ayam Iti Vyaadhih Unmaada Iti Kirtitah || Su.U.62/3; M.N.20/1 3. Manaso yo Madah Sa Unmaado Naama Roga Uchyate | A.H.Ni.6/1 Arun`adatta Hilarity in mind is nothing but Unmaada. Svaroopa Mano Vibhrama In this state a person does not think of a thing which is worth thinking and thinks of what he should not think. This is perversion of functions of mind. Buddhi Vibhrama Due to perversion of intellect, a person thinks that eternal things are ephemeral, and momentary things are eternal. Likewise, he hates the beloved ones and loves the hated ones. Sandnyaa Dnyaana Vibhrama Due to perversion in Sandnyaa and Dnyaana, a person is unable to perceive the burns caused by fire. Smriti Vibhrama This is perversion of memory. A person does not memorize or memorizes incorrectly. Bhakti Vibhrama Bhakti is Ichchha i.e. desire. Perversion in desire makes previously desired things undesirable. S`heela Vibhrama If a person is cool and calm, then due to perversion in S`heela, he becomes angry. Chesht`aa Vibhrama Due to perversion in behaviour, a person indulges in undesirable activities. Aachaara Vibhrama Due to perversion of conduct, a person behaves in antireligious activities. The perversion is caused by the Dosha or endogenous cause. Actually, no supernatural cause as god, Gandharva etc afflict the person who himself is free from sinful deeds. However these entities affect person with sinful acts and low physical and mental capabilities. The primary causes of Unmaada in an individual are his own misdeeds and other agents like the gods act only as the consequence of these misdeeds. It means that as Unmaada is caused by misdeeds of a person, they can not be again caused by gods etc. So actually, a person himself is responsible for Unmaada and not the other entities. Therefore Aayurveda denies supernatural origin of Unmaada. It concludes that Unmaada is a Pradnyaaparaadhaja disease  causes due to the misconducts in Dhee, Dhriti, Smriti. Prayers of god and resorting to wholesome regimens act as antidote to the misdeeds of an individual. Thus the power to avert or to invite Unmaada lies with the individual himself. A person who abstains from eating meat and drinking alcohol and takes only wholesome food, who is disciplined and pure and who has strong will power does not get afflicted by Nija or Aagantu factors. Unmaada Types (Sus`hruta has not counted Vishaja Unmaada while enumerating the types, but has explained Vishaja Unmaada differently as it requires a different treatment.) Mada Unmaada at the stage of manifestation when the disease is new with fewer symptoms is called Mada.  Vishaja Unmaada In this type of Unmaada, eyes get red, patient loses his strength, complexion and capacity to perceive (Hatabalendriyabhaah), becomes wretched (Sudeena), has change in the colour of the face, which becomes dark brown (S`hyaavaanana). If untreated, then the patient dies off this Vishaja Unmaada. Unmaada though of 5 types, it can be grouped in to 2 types only. At times, due to the combination of etiological factors, they are manifested in a combined form. There is a combination of prodromal and actual symptoms. Curability of Unmaada according to combination Doshaja (Nija) Unmaada First four types of Unmaada, which occur due to predominance of Dosha, are manifested in the following circumstances: When a person is timid When mind is afflicted by Rajas and Tamas When the Dosha are aggravated and vitiated When a person consumes unwholesome diet and unclean ingredients having mutually contradictory properties or touched by the unclean hands of persons suffering from the diseases like Kusht`ha etc. When a person eats food violating all the dietetic rules (not obeying Aahaara Vidhi Vis`heshaayatanaani), When a person does not behave according to the Sadvritta (behavioral regimen), and because of which his body gets excessively depleted When a person is in diseased condition, When his mind is afflicted by Kaama (desire), Krodha (anger), Lobha (cupidity), Harsha (bristling), Bhaya (fear), Moha (infatuation), Aayaasa (exertion), S`hoka (sorrow), Chintaa (anxiety), Udvega (agitation), When a person is subjected to excessive physical assault, When his mind (Manas) gets seriously affected and his intellect (Buddhi) loses its balance, In above conditions Dosha get aggravated and vitiated. They enter into the Hridaya and obstruct the channel of mind (Manovaha Srotas) resulting in Unmaada (insanity). Person having less Sattva (less tolerance to physical and mental stress), are more prone to Unmada. Aagantu Unmaada (Bhootaja Unmaada) The type of Unmaada, which has different Samutthaana (etiology), Poorvaroopa (Prodromal symptoms), Roopa (symptoms), Vedanaa (pain), and Upas` haya (pacifying factors) from Unmaada of Doshaja type, is called Aagantu Unmaada. According to some scholars, causative factor of Unmaada is sinful acts in past life, which are caused due to Pradnyaaparaadha. The causative factors of Aagantu Unmaada, initiate their action when: Due to Pradnyaaparaadha the person disregards Devarshi, Pitri, Gandharva, Yaksha, Raakshasa, Pis`haacha, Guru, Vriddha, Siddha Aachaarya, Poojya (honorable) personalities. When a person remains engaged in undesirable activities, Unmaada gets manifested due to his own sinful / inauspicious acts. Hetu The causative factors of Aagantu Unmaada, initiate their action when: Sampraapti Qualities and powers of the gods etc. cause seizures of the individual without afflicting his physique. These supernatural beings are invisible and they afflict the human being instantaneously on the analogy of the reflection of ones picture in the mirror or sun rays in Sooryakaanta Man`i (Sun Stone), without significantly affecting (the body or the gem). Unmaada due to Supernatural powers Supernatural powers affect person of less mental strength (Heena Sattva) in following conditions: These are the circumstances in which a person is attached by exogenous type (Aagantu) of Umnaada. Objectives of Supernatural powers (Bhoota) in Unmaada Unmaada is caused by the agents with three objectives: When intention of an agent is to cause injury, a person enters into the fire, sinks into the water, falls into a pit, strikes himself with weapons, whips etc. He may also adopt such things to kill himself. This is incurable. Unmaada caused for Ratih and Abhyarchanaa are curable.

Synonyms: Nirukti: The disease caused by vitiation of Vaata and Rakta is Vaatarakta. There is dominance of Vaayu and not of Rakta; so it is not named as Raktavaata. Types According to sites: According to Dosha Though it has explained as Uttaana and Gambheera, Sus`hruta says that Vaatarakta like Kusht`ha turns into Avagaad`ha after Uttaana stage. Therefore, it is not necessary to describe it two types. Su.Chi.5/3 Sukumaara, people indulged in unwholesome diet or obese, living happily such types of person are more prone to have Vaatarakta. Su.Chi.5/5 Sampraapti: Trauma, As`huddhi (not performing Panchakarma therapy), swimming, walking in sun heat, suppressing natural urges, etc. lead to the aggravation of Vaayu. This aggravated Vaayu gets covered by Rakta (Aavaran`a) It vitiates Rakta. Vaayu is Sookshma and Sara (it traverses through the body). Rakta is Drava (liquid) and Sara. They both traverse through the Siraa and affect the inter-phalangeal joints. They cause the deformity in the joints and the joints get crooked. There the symptoms are manifested according to the association of Dosha. Generally, the pains are manifested in the joints and this pain is very serious and intolerable. Lakshan`a (Clinical presentation): It shows severe pain with other symptoms like burning, redness etc. The start of the pain is at the root of the feet (metacarpal joints, ankle joint etc.) as accumulation of the blood starts from the joints of the feet. It may also starts from the joints of the hands also. It spreads in the body like rat poison as it stabilizes at a place and then spreads all over the body. It does not spread fast. Vaatarakta is manifested with the symptoms like Kusht`ha. In VaataRakta the successive Dhaatu from Maamsa are vitiated and it turns it to the Gambheera VaataRakta Avasthaa. Sites of Vaatarakta manifestation: Hands, feet, fingers and all the joints are sites of manifestation. At the onset Vaatarakta is manifested on the hands and feet, and then it spreads all over the body. Upadrava of Vaatarakta Vaatarakta is a disease in which channel of Rakta Dhaatu is obstructed by Vaayu and the movements of Vaayu are obstructed by Rakta; which leads to this serious and acute condition.

Sampraapt: All the three vitiated Dosha are responsible for Visarpa. Owing to their excessive vitiation, Dooshya are called as Mala. C.Chi.21/15 (Chakrapaan`i) Rakta Maamsa Tvak Laseekaa (Jalam  M.Ni. T`eekaa AatankaDarpan`a) Vaataja Visarpa: Aggravation of Vaayu is the most important factor in manifestation of Visarpa. Vaayu is aggravated either by its own reason (Svatantra Hetu) like hot and dry substances or it gets aggravated due to Maargaavarodha (Pooran`a) [Paratantra Hetu]. This aggravated Vaayu vitiates Dooshya (Rakta, Maamsa, Laseekaa, Tvak) spreading them all over the body. This is Visarpa. Pittaja Visarpa: Pitta gets accumulated (Chaya) due to hot dietary and behavioral regimen, Vidaahee and sour food. It enters the Dhamanee, vitiating the Dooshya (Rakta, Maamsa, Tvak, Laseekaa) and traverse through the body. Kaphaja Visarpa: Due to sweet, sour, salty, heavy and unctuous food Kapha accumulates (Chaya) in the body. It vitiating Dooshya (Rakta, Maamsa, Tvak, Laseekaa) spreads slowly (Ksichchhram Visarpati  S`heeghram S`hareere na Visarpati; Chakrapaan`i Ch. Chi.21.33) VaataPittaja Visarpa (Agni Visarpa): Vaata and Pitta, both get aggravated excessively due to their causative factors. They both aggravate each other (Parasparam Labdhabalam Anyonya Vardhita S`haktikam  Chakrapaan`i). They spread Dooshya all over the body causing burning sensation like red hot coal. This is Agni Visarpa. KaphaPittaja Visarpa (Kardamaka Visarpa): Kapha and Pitta aggravated due to their strong causative factors gets spreaded through the body putrifying the Dooshya. It does not spread quickly (Alasaka  Manda Visarpee). It does not affect all the body parts (Eka Des`ha Graahee  Na Sarva S`hareera Vyaapaka). It is Kardama Visarpa. It resembles to muddy appearance. KaphaVaataja Visarpa (Granthi Visarpa): Kapha and Vaayu aggravate due to their causative factors. They both get vitiated and aggravated (Dusht`i and Prakopa) and vitiate Dooshya (Rakta, Maamsa, Tvak, Laseekaa). Vaayu obstructed due to Kapha, penetrates Kapaha, producing line of cysts (Granthi) which are slowly suppurated. These cysts are formed in Rakta, Siraa, Snaayu, Maamsa, and Tvak. Kshataja Visarpa: Due to the exogenous causes Vaayu gets aggravated. This aggravated Vaayu vitiates Pitta with Rakta. There is immense swelling (S`hotha), Jvara, Rujaa (Pain) and burning sensation (Daaha) and blisters (Sphot`a) on the skin. Rakta turns to S`hyaava Varn`a. Pitta and Rakta enter into the fresh wound generating swelling like Kulattha (Horse Gram).

Chi. 23, S. Ka. 1 Nirukti: Mythological aspect: When the churning of ocean (Samudra Manthana) was carried out by Gods and demons to get the nectar / ambrosia; there evolved the frightful man (Ghora Purusha) before evolution of nectar. After looking at him, the entire world turned in to sorrowful state (Vishan`n`a). He was shining brightly, was having four large teeth. The colour of his hairs was reddish brown (Pingala). His eyes was of fire (Anila Ikshan`a). This Purusha was called as Visha, as he made entire creatures sorrowful / depressed. Thus, the Visha, literally called as poison, is having aquatic origin (Ambu Sambhava). This Visha was directed in to two types as its origin 1. Jangama (coming from living beings) 2. Sthaavara (any stationary or inanimate object, plant kingdom) Visha manifests with As explained earlier, being aquatic in origin, the Visha becomes more powerful in rainy season (Varshaa Ritu). Whereas in autumn (S`harad Ritu) due to upcoming of the star Agasti, the strength of Visha decreases. Origin of Jangama Visha: All these creatures are labeled as Damsht`ree as they have poisons in their teeth. (Damsht`raa = Large Tooth) According to Sus`hruta, there are 16 types of origin of Jangama Visha. They are as follows: Damsht`raa   Bhauma Sarpa, Maarjaara, S`hva, Vaanara, Makara, Man`d`ooka, Paakamatsya, Godhaa, S`hambooka, Prachalaaka, Grihagodhikaa, Chatushpaada, Keet`a Nakha --  Maarjaara, S`hva, Vaanara, Makara, Man`d`ooka, Paakamatsya, Godhaa, S`hambooka, Prachalaaka, Grihagodhikaa, Chatushpaada, Keet`a, Lootaa Mootra --  Chipit`a, Pichchit`aka, Kashaayavaasika, Sarshapa, Tot`aka, Varchahkeet`a, Kaun`d`in`yaka, Lootaa Pureesha--  Chipit`a, Pichchit`aka, Kashaayavaasika, Sarshapa, Tot`aka, Varchahkeet`a, Kaun`d`in`yaka, Lootaa Aara --  Vris`hchika, Vis`hvambhara, Varat`ee, Raajeevamatsya, Uchchit`inga, Samudra Vris`hchika Origin of Sthaavara Visha: According to Sus`hruta, there are 10 types of origin of Sthaavara Visha.

Vega of Visha Effects of Visha are observed in human being by different modes one by one, which is called as Visha Vega. These Visha Vega are 8 according to Charaka.

Tooth at the left lower side is black, left upper side is yellow, lower right is red and right upper is horse brown coloured (S`hyaava). The colour of the bitten site turns to the same colour as of the colour of the tooth.

Knowledge of the origin, development and toxicity manifestation of accumulated poisons and suitable remedial measures are an integral part of health. Present food habits, life style and mental attitudes etc, are entirely different from the past. The basic essentials of a healthy life such as air, food and water are all polluted and the resultant hazards paint a gloomy picture for the generations to come. The greatest gift we can offer to the new generation is a clean world. Ayurveda states that health and disease are caused by the right and wrong foods respectively. Elaborate descriptions regarding the food and drinks fit for continuous use, foods that can be taken occasionally and foods to be strictly avoided are detailed in texts (A.H.Su.7 & 8). There is a misconception that Ayurveda advocates only vegetarian foods, Non-vegetarian foods are also advised in health and certain diseases. The beneficial and therapeutic effects of the meat of animals, birds and fish are also given in detail while describing similar effects of cereals, pulses and vegetables. (Asht`aanga Hridaya Sootrasthaana Chapter.6) The qualities and therapeutic effects of potable liquids such as rain water, river water, water contained in ponds and wells; cold water, warm water, water previously boiled and maintained at room temperature etc are also given in A.H.Su.7. Similarly, the qualities of milks in general, cows milk, buffalos milk, goats milk, breast milk, elephants milk, curds, buttermilk, sour buttermilk, butter, clarified butter, sugarcane juice, jaggery sugar candy and honey are also included in the same chapter. Qualities of edible oils such as sesame oil, mustard oil, margosa oil etc and the therapeutic effects of Castor oil are also described; Animal fats are included in certain oils used externally and at times, internally. The right food and the wrong food vary from person to person. Based on Dosha_s / humors, humans are divided into three main groups. The physical appearance likes and dislikes mental attitudes of all these groups are given in detail in chapter 3 of Asht`aanga Hridaya S`haareera Sthaana. Predominance of elements such as air, fire and water gives rise to three basic natures termed Vaata, Pitta and Kapha. We commonly see and admixture of all the three natures in diseased and healthy individuals alike. The right food, drinks and habits vary in each of these groups and therefore medicines also vary. Endogenous toxic manifestations are caused mainly by ingestion of the wrong and incompatible food, inhalation of polluted air and staying in unhealthy surroundings. The food regimens are to be altered or readjusted depending upon the seasons. Elimination of accumulated metabolic wastes is absolutely essential for the maintenance of health in Ayurveda. Exogenous toxic manifestations are caused by factors outside the body and based on their nature, are broadly classified as in inanimate (Sthaavara) and animate (Jangama) poisons. The main channels of elimination of toxic metabolites in the body are through feces, urine, sweat and breath. When these excretory channels are blocked there is an accumulation of materials unwanted or harmful to the body that results in a wide range of toxic manifestations ranging from headache to death. Therefore, the basic principle of treatment is to open up these channels of elimination whereby the wastes are eliminated, paving way for the normalization of the functions of the body. The primary classification of poison is a) natural (Akritrima) b) artificial (Kritrima). Natural poisons are again classified as Inanimate (Sthaavara or static) and animate (Jangama or mobile). Some authors also include concocted poison (prepared by combining natural and artificial poisons). This third type, in general is termed Gara. Some non-poisonous substances become poisonous by virtue of the mere combination and these are also included in Gara. Some foods having diametrically opposing actions on the physiological system become incompatible with the body and give rise to toxicity manifestations, usually in the long run. They are also considered similar to Gara by some authors. Natural poisons are divided into inanimate (Sthaavara) and animate (Jangama). Inanimate poisons include poisons of plant origin and toxic minerals, metals / metal ores in their natural form embedded in the earth. Animate poisons include venoms of the living such as venoms of reptiles, scorpions, worms, insects etc. The substrata of natural inanimate poisons are ten viz. root, leaves, fruits, flower, bark, latex, heartwood, resins, toxic minerals and tuber. (S.K. 2/4) Animate poisons have a wider substrata base. They are sixteen viz. sight, breath, teeth / fangs, nails, urine, feces, semen, saliva, menstrual blood, pincers, anal region, beak bones, bile, hair and a dead body. Artificial Poisons (Gara): Artificial poison, also termed concocted poison is prepared by the combinations of various animate and inanimate poisons. They contain parts of insect, blood of animals, fecal matter, ashes of different toxic herbs of opposing actions, toxic minerals and poisons of low potency. (A.H.U.35/49) Charaka the well-known physician describes two types of artificial poisons. One is composed of non-poisonous matter given in combination. Separately nontoxic these act as poisons when ingested in a combined form. Toxic materials of animate and inanimate origin are combined to prepare the second type. This can be termed `true` Gara. Gara and true Gara metabolize very slowly. The ill effects are not initially so grave, but only a menace. In the long run, both are fatal. (C.Chi.23/14) Charaka summarizes the ill effects of animate poisons as lethargy, lassitude, horripilation, burning sensation, purulent lesions and diarrhea (C.Chi.23/15) Dryness (Rooksha Gun`a) vitiates Vaata. Pitta and blood are vitiated by the property of heat. Too much sharpness (Taakshn`ya) affects the brain causing madness to varying degrees. Vital points of the body both structural and functional (Marma); are shattered. Minuteness (Soukshmya) permits free entry of poisons to the remote sites of the body causing derangement. Speed (Aas`hutva) eats away at the roots of life spreads without proper digestion (Vyavaayee) and affects the basic structure (Prakriti) of the victim, muscle relaxant effect (Vikaashitva) reduces humors, tissues (Dhaatu) and wastes are expelled through the natural orifices of the body (Mala) and debilitates their functions in preserving the integrity of the body. Clarity (Vais`hadya) facilitates unopposed entry of poison to the minutest orifices of the body and aids its spread lightness (Laghutva makes it indigestible and inaccessible for biotransformation and indigestibility (Avipaakitva) makes its elimination difficult as, it is not metabolized naturally (S.K.2/17). Thus all the properties mentioned above act in unison to trouble the patient for a prolonged period (S.K.2/21). Poisons first vitiate blood, and then vitiate the humors Kapha, Pitta and Vaata in sequence along with their substrata, proceed to the heart and become fatal (A.H.U.35/9-10). All properties of poison are fast acting. These results in the vitiation of all humors that render the latter from performing natural functions attributed to them. Biotransformation is one function of the humors and adverse affection of this function precipitates retention of toxins in the body and their elimination is blocked. The vital centers regulating respiration, cardiac functions, vasomotor tone etc. get enveloped due to the deranged Kapha and the patient becomes comatose. Life remains hidden in his body but his sensory and motor functions are apparently absent. The physicians duty is to melt off the Kapha, blanketing the vital force of life, and if he fails to do so death is sure to intervene. (S. K.3/23-25). In snakebites, the venom is retained in the spot for 100 seconds. Combined with Vaata, it reaches the forehead and then the eyes. Thereafter, it spreads to tissues like a drop of oil placed on the surface of water. (Prayoga Samuchchaya P.33). The tissues (Dhaatu_s) in this context are skin, blood, muscles, fatty tissue, and bone and reproductive tissue. Thereafter, the poison spreads to the six plexus (Chakra) Moolaadhaara, Svaadhisht`haana, Man`ipooraka, Anaahata and Vis`huddhi. (Functional vital points, described by some as nerve plexus also. Further details are obtainable in Yoga.) The Poison then spreads from Aadnyaa Chakra to Brahma Randhra. The life force is always one step ahead of poison during the whole process and in this desperate flight. The life force reaches a point in the head (brain) termed as Karantaka. Within 13 days, this point also succumbs and death supervenes. This is the usual process. If the potency of poison is high and the strength of life force is weak, the patient may die earlier also. Concept of Phases and Interphases (Vega & Vegaantara): A membrane separates each of the seven tissues. Traversing each membrane the poison creates a phase to do its worst. The Dhaatu_s are Rasa, Rakta, Maamsa, Meda, Asthi Majjaa and S`hukra. They are contained in cisterns bordered by membranes (Kalaa). Poison, in its effort to spread through the tissues breaks, the membranes and enters the tissue. Situated in the tissue, the poison precipitates certain symptoms. (S.K.4/43) During the process of spread, poison takes sometime to gain entry from the earlier Dhaatu to the latter. This period is termed as Vegaantara, is relatively symptom free. Vaata is the Dosha facilitating the movement. Some authors specify substrates occupied by poison during Vega. Some give only the number and Vega_s. The majority accepts seven Vega_s. Symptoms present during phases of inanimate and animate poisons differ, and also the treatment. Phases with reference to inanimate poison are given below (A.H.U. 35/9-15) Phase (Vega): Black color of tongue, stiffness, disorientation (startling), vomiting, lethargy and unconsciousness. Shivering, sweating, burning sensation, throat pain poisons reaches stomach (Aamaas`haya) and precipitate chest pain. Dryness of palate, intense stomachache, eyes edematous green shaded, with reduced response to reflexes, poison reaches the intestines, causes griping, hiccup and Borborygmus, cough. Heaviness of head Salivation, change of body color, splitting pain of joints, vitiation of all humor and severe pain of the colon Severe diarrhea and unconsciousness Causes spasmodic flexion of spine involving shoulder, dorsum and sacral region, spasm, convulsion and death. Phases with reference to animate (snake) poison (Su. K. 4/42): While elaborating on snake poison, Sus`hruta, the learned physician states symptoms bases on tissues / different systems / organs of the body. Only the phases of Cobra poisoning are discussed here: Vitiates blood, blood turns black, body turns black hyperaesthesia. Vitiates flesh intensification of black / blue color of the body; edema, nodular swellings all over the body. Vitiates fatty tissue [Medas], oozing of serum from the bite, heaviness of head, absence of sweating, immobility of eyes. Enters gut, [Kosht`ha] and causes predominant vitiation of Kapha causing lethargy, salivation and disability of joints. Enters Bone, vitiates Praan`a (a faction of the humor Vaata and digestive system splitting pain of joints hiccup and generalized burning sensation. Enters reproductive tissue (S`hukra) vitiates a faction of Vaata based on the heart (Vyaana) secretes mucous material (Kapha) from micro-Orifices, wick like mucus secretion from nose, salivation, profuse sweating, cessation of breath, coma and death. (A.S.K. 4/40) Charaka consolidates the definition of poison. The origin of poison was from water. It aggravates during the rainy season and its ill effects are reduced by irrigation with water, it resembles fire (Sage Vyaasa describes the origin of fire from water Abdayoni) in its capacity to spread fast, it has eight phases ten properties and 24 treatments. (C.Chi 23/6) Like solid Jaggery liquefying during the rainy season, poisons also spread during rain showing their full potency. When the rain ends, the Sharada (autumn) season follows, the star Canopus (Agastya) raises and reduces the potency of poison. (C. Chi 23/8) The spread of animate poison is downwards and that of inanimate poison is upwards. Toxins of inanimate origin are and antidote for poison from fangs and vice-versa (C.Chi. 23/17) Poison, gaining entry into the body vitiates blood, Kapha. Pitta and Vaata including their substrates and cisterns placed proximally and distally in the body. Afterwards it reaches the heart and spreads along the circulatory system to ending the death of the victim (A.H.U. 35/9-10) When poison is located in Vaata, symptoms of vitiation of the humor predominate, followed by minimal vitiation of other humors; Similarly presence of poison in Pitta produces symptoms of vitiation of Pitta. Predominant symptoms of vitiation of Kapha are observed when poison is located in Kapha. (C.Chi.23/27-30) By vitiating each humor, the poison robs a man of his life. (C.Chi. 23/31) In venomous bites and wounds from poisoned arrows, the poison is restricted to the site; but when the poison is ingested, it damages the functions of blood, blocks the vessels, lodges in the heart and kills the victim (C.Chi. 23/33). Snakes (Sarpa): Classification of snakes, symptoms of envenomation and treatment forms a major chunk of Ayurvedic toxicology. Sus`hruta classifies snakes under two main heads, celestial (Divya) and terrestrial (Bhauma). Pathology and treatment with respect to the celestial snakes are not mentioned. They are worshipped. Terrestrial snakes are classified as follows: Terrestrial snakes (Bhauma Sarpa) Cobra (Darveekara)     26 types Viper (Man`d`ali)   22 types Krait (Raajila)     10 types Non-poisonous (Nirvisha)     12 types Mixed type (Vaikaranja or Vyantara)    3 types Admixed type originating from mixed types (Citra / Vaikaranjotbhava) 7 types ---------- Another classification is based on the caste of the snake akin to the for castes in classical Indian society viz. Braahman`a, Kshatriya, Vais`ya and Kshudra appearances of these snakes are detailed in S.K. 4/23-26 Based on sex snakes are classified into three: Male (Purusha) Female (Stree) and Eunuch (Napumsaka) (A.S.U.41). Based on age snakes are classified as: Young (Baala) Adolescent (Tarun`a) and Old (Vriddha). Depending upon the status of the female they are classified into two viz. Pregnant (Garbhin`ee) and newly delivered (Sootaa) (A.S.U 41) Bites happen when snakes mistake part of the body as food; when frightened; when stamped over; when venom in their sac has accumulated; when angered, due to their vile nature, as revenge and when incited by gods, sages, or the God of death (Yama). Gravity of bite increases in an ascending order. Classification of snakebite Five types of bites are described in Ashtaan`ga Hridaya. (A.H.U.36/11-13): Saliva of snake present, no bite marks (Tund`a Aahata) One or two fang marks, no bleeding Vyaaleedha One or two fang marks with bleeding Vyaalupta Three fang marks with oozing of blood, muscle puncture (Dasht`aka) Four fang marks, muscle penetrated, puncture of blood vessel (vein) as in the case of intravenous injection. (Dasht`anipeedita) The first two are non-poisonous and the last three venomous. Sus`hruta classifies bites into three, highly poisonous types (Sarpita) Reticulate (Radita) and non-poisonous (Nirvisha) Fangs (Damstra) Charaka describes the snakes four fangs left lower (Vaamaadhara), left upper (Vaamottara), these right lower (Dakshinaadhara), right upper (Dakshinottara) and these upper fangs are more powerful. Color of fangs and body spot bitten and quantity of venom contained in each fang is given below: - Left lower white 1 drop  left upper yellow 2 drops Right lower red 3 drops right upper black 4 drops Jyotsnika (chapter 3/8-11) mentions four fangs viz. Karaalee. Maakaree, Kaalaraatree and Yamadootikaa. Bites by Karaalee and Yamadootikaa are near fatal. Pricking pain, itching, edema, pain, burning sensation and solidification of bitten part are the characteristic features of venomous bite. Absence of these symptoms indicates a non-venomous bite. The venom of cobra is pungent (Kat`u Rasa) and rough (Rooksha Gun`a). It vitiates Vaata; potency of venom is increased in the young snakes and during the rainy season. Venom of viper is sour and hot in potency. It vitiates Pitta, potency of venom increases in middle age and in the cold season. Venom of krait is sweet and is cold in potency. It vitiates Kapha. Potency of venom is increased in old age of the snake and in the summer season. Insect Poisoning (Keet`a Visha): Insects (Keet`a_s) are classified and treated based on their ability to vitiate humors. In Ashtaan`ga Hridaya, it is stated that in insect bite or sting, predominant vitiation is of Vaata and Pitta. (A.H.U. 37/16) Sush`ruta differs from this opinion stating that insect poison is slow acting and hence not capable of vitiating Pitta. As the main vitiation is of Vaata and Kapha sudation is permitted. The generally accepted line of treatment in poisons is cold (S`heeta), but in insect poisoning the cold therapy will aggravate vitiation of Kapha and it is contra-indicated (S.K.6/26), (S.K. 3/29) Scorpion Poisoning (Vrishchika Visha): Based on the strength of venom, scorpions are classified into mildly poisonous (Manda), medium-poisonous [Madhya], and highly poisonous (Mahaavisha). The venom, spreading upwards from the site of sting very fast, returns and remains at the sting spot. Predominant vitiation is of Vaata (A.H.U. 37/6). Spider Poisoning (Lootaa Visha): There are several small and large varieties of spiders. General symptoms of poisoning, development of lesion and appearance of symptoms for the first seven days are given in the texts. Severe spider poisoning is fatal. The classification and treatment is based on the vitiation of humors (A.H.U. 37/47) and the potency of the venom. Dress and articles of daily used contaminated by spiders also cause toxic manifestations (A.H.U. 37/65) Symptoms subside within twenty-one days. If they persist, treatment should be changed. Rat Poisoning (Mooshika Visha): Rats semen is said to be the substrate of poison and the main vitiation is of Kapha. Burning, bloodletting, external application of medicines, administration of emetics purgatives, nasal medication collyrium (eye medication) etc. are employed in its treatment. It is stated that residual rat poison, if not eliminated, will flare up during cloudy days (A.H.U. 38/33). Contamination of water and rats urine gives rise to infections. Rabies (Alarka Visha): The vitiated Kapha of fox, jackal, dog and other Quadrupeds block the sensory nerves causing characteristic symptoms of madness. Bitten by these animals, one becomes mad as the poison progresses. Preparation containing thorn apple (Dattoora) Alangium (Sarapunkhaa) in the form of a cake was given to patients to generate madness before its natural onset. The detailed process is given in Sus`hruta Kalpa 7/51-56. Development of symptoms simulating madness in the normal course of the disease is fatal. Bite should be cauterized with hot ghee or metal. Local application of medicines, purgatives mixed with the latex of Mandaara (Arka-Calotropis gigantean) and consumption of antidotes are indicated. Other minor poisoning: Wasp, bees, flies, insect, lizards, leeches, centipedes, frog, beetle, mosquito, etc. can be sources of minor poisoning. Symptoms and treatment are given in S.K.8. Denatured poison (Doosheevisha): Attenuated or denatured poisons function as latent toxins in the body. One who suffers from latent poison (Dooshee Visha) will have loose motion, his complexion will be altered, his mouth will emit foul smell, his olfactory and gustatory senses will be impaired and he will suffer from unquenchable thirst. Slurring and broken speech, vomiting, sorrow and sudden bouts of unconsciousness are also seen. He will suffer from symptoms of chronic Ascites (Dooshyodara), (detailed in A.H.Ni.12/20-21)caused by Vitiation of all humors. (S.K.2/27). Situated in the stomach (Aamaas`haya) denatured poison vitiates Kapha and Vaata, in intestines (Pakvaas`haya) it precipitates diseases originating from the vitiation of Vaata and Pitta. His hairs will fall off, body will be emaciated and he appears like a bird with its feathers and wings clipped off. (S.K.12/28). A deeper entry of latent toxins into tissues result in their derangement and subsequent diseases. The ill effects increase when the season is cold and windy. On cloudy days, the sun also aggravates the symptoms. (S.K.2/29). If the above condition is also neglected, he suffers from anorexia and instead of providing satiation, food precipitates intoxication Urticaria, deterioration of tissues, unconsciousness, edema of the extremities, intense thirst, vomiting, diarrhea, Ascites, irregular fever and loss of body color demarcate this stage (S.K.2/30) Advancing further, it causes flatulence, impaired functions of reproductive tissue, stammering and insanity. Widespread skin lesions are also seen (S.K.2/32) The following factors cause aggravation of the above symptoms and therefore it is termed Dooshee Visha. S.K.2/33) The patient should be subjected to sudation, after which induction of emesis (Vamana) and catharsis (Virechana) will have to be done. The purpose of sudation is to bring the Latent humors situated in Dhaatu_s to alimentary tract (Kosht`ha). Once brought to the gut they can be eliminated through the mouth or anus by the induction of emesis or purgation. (A.H.U.34/38) Dooshee Vishaaree Agada (A.H.U. C.35 / 38-39) finely powdered and mixed with an excess quantity of honey is to be consumed. Concocted Poison [Gara]: Concocted poison is artificial poison. Different parts of the body of insects, blood, menstrual blood, urine Faeces etc of human and animal origin, medicines having diametrically opposing action on the same physiological system, ashes (Bhasma_s) of metallic and mineral origin containing toxic material and poisons of low potency are mixed together in the composition of Gara (A.H.U. 35/49) While prescribing medicines one should take sufficient care to see that the medicines are compatibles. Coupling medicines having hot (Ushn`a) and cold (S`heeta) potency, mixing an anti-diarrhea drug with a cathartic, mixing of a weight reducing agent with nourishing ghee etc, are against the basic principles of this science, It is stated that incompatible food can be equated with poison or Gara. Incompatible medicines also can be considered under the above group. Females infatuated by the male used to give him concocted poisons in order to seduce him to be her husband. It was also used to poison a king as per the direction of spies of enemy; concocted poisons mixed with food were given to the king with the help of workers in the royal kitchen. Lust, vanity etc. may also be other motives. (A.H.U.35/48). Loss of weight, anemia, - anorexia, cough, breathing disorders, fever, narcolepsy, depression, Ascitis, Hepatomegaly, Splenomegaly, feeble or husky voice, flatulence, debility, lethargy, edema, slimming of arms and legs, wasting disorders etc. are the effects of the slow acting poison. In the second stage somatic symptoms give way to psychic disorders. In dreams he visualizes fox, cat, mongoose; ferocious animals, monkey, dry ponds or wells, dry climbers (plant) etc. Fair complexioned people mistake their color for dark and vice versa. He may be obsessed that his nose and face have ceased to exist. The patient suffers such or more severe afflictions of the body and mind. Unless treated immediately he awaits an impending doom. (A.H.U.35/50-54) Induction of emesis by suitable emetics, consumption of compatible (Pathya) food and drinks and medication with gold is the desire line of treatment (A.H.U.35/55) To the enemy a king and his soldiers poisoned food, water, air, land, grass, and fumes etc. of the enemy territory. (Todays pollution presents a similar picture). Methods to identify the poisoning and a process of such purification are described in S.K.3 Symptoms of wounds caused by a poisoned arrows and treatment are given in A.H.U.35/40-44 Sus`ruta, Samhitaa, Kalpa Sthaana chapter 1, discusses ancient methods of poisoning the king or enemies. The elementary portions of criminology and body language are given in the chapter under the head How to identify the person who have poisoned the food of the king. Methods to identify poisoned food drinks, dishes, vegetables, cereal soup, fruits, tooth brush, tongue cleaner, oils applied externally, astringent liquids used to remove oil, comb, water for bathing, perfumes applied externally such as sandalwood paste etc, garlands dress materials, armor, ornaments, footwear, bangles, bed and foot rest are discussed in detail. Medicated oils used as nasal drops; eye drops, eardrops, fumigating materials etc. are likely to be poisoned. Methods to identify them are also included in the chapter. The treatment is also given. The king used to travel on a horse or an elephant. Application on the dorsum of these animals with a view to harm the king was usual in those days. Symptoms of these poisoned animals and the rider and the treatment is also mentioned. Characteristic features of polluted air, water, land, poisoned grass, fumes, smoke etc. and methods of purification using herbal remedies and processes for purification are given in detail in Sus`hruta Samhitaa, Kalpasthaana Chapter 3. Toxic Dame (Visha Kanyaa) Toxic or venomous substances were given to females from childhood and the doses were increased gradually as age advances. At the time of puberty, they were saturated with poison. They were used to seduce the enemy king. Ways to identify such toxic dames are given in the text. (S.K.1/6 commentary of D`alhan`a). Her sweat, touch, contact kiss etc. were harmful and sexual union was an invitation to death. Today the slow poisoned horse serum is used to prepare antivenin. Treatment is based on the involved humors. Charaka describes 24 methods of therapy. Treatment is also done based on stages and symptoms (C.Chi. 23/35-37) Twenty four specific treatment of poisons (Visha) as detailed by Charaka are as follows: Chanting of Mantra_s Mantra Ligation Arisht`abandhana Local blood letting by incising Utkartana Application of pressure to drain the venom Nishpeed`ana Suction Chooshan`a Burning Agni Irrigation Parisheka Immersion bath Avagaaha Blood letting Raktamokshan`a S.K.5/34 Vomitting Vamana Ref S.K. 5/34 Purging Vireka S.K. 5/38 Application of medicine on head After incision: Upaadhaana S.K.5/42-45 Administration of ghee to protect heart Hridayaavaran`a Ch Chi 23/46-50 Collyrium Eye medication Anjana S.K. 5/39 Nasal medication Nasya S.K. 5/40 Medicated Fumigation Dhoopa / Dhooma Consumption of Medicated jam Leha Removal of residual poison Prashamana Dusting of medicated powder Pratisaaran`a Antivenom/antitoxinPrativisha(A.H.U. Vishopayogeeyam Ch.48) Medicines to bring back senses Sadnyasamsthaapana Application of medicated paste Lepa Revival of the apparently dead Mr. Tasan Jeevana The treatment or administration of toxic antidotes (Prativisha) is based on the opposing action of animate and inanimate poisons. In root poisoning, snake venom is used as an antidote and in certain severe snake/scorpion poisoning; plant poisons are used externally or internally. When the fifth phase is over and seventh phase is about to supervene, toxic antidotes are administered. This mode of treatment is resorted to under dire circumstances when Mantra_s and other life saving measures fail. Complications (Prativisha): In snakebite and plant toxicity treatments, sixteen complications are to be anticipated. These are described along with treatment in Asht`aanga Samgraha Uttaratantra Ch 47. Fever (Jvara) Cough (Kaasa) Vomitting (Vami) Breathing difficulty (S`hvaasa) Hiccup (Hikkaa) Thirst (Thrushn`aa) Unconsciousness (Moorchana) Diarrhea (Vit`bheda) Constipation (Vitbandha) Flatulence (Aanaaha) Tenderness of bladder (Basti Ruk) Headache (Moordharuk) Edema (S`hayathu) Necrotic Ulcer (Pootidamshatvam) Hemorrhage (Rakta Sraava) Toxic Neruropathy (Vishaaneela) When the weak are subjected to blood letting, when the patient consumes excess of dry food or due to the specific nature of the venom, Vaata gets vitiated giving rise to insanity, epilepsy, mental derangement, convulsive disorders etc. The treatment should be medicated enema (Basti), insufflations of medicated powder into the nose (Pradhamana), Nasal medication (Nasya) and Collyrium (Anjana) A.S.U Ch 47 As mentioned earlier, the treatment is to open up the excretory channels. One common finding in a large number of skin lesions such as weeping eczema, itching, falling of hair due to inflammatory lesion of hair follicles etc. There is chronic constipation and persistent urinary tract infections. Susceptibility to infections is frequent. To relieve the patient from these disorders, administration of Pat`olakat`urohinyaadi Kashaaya and / or Punarnavaadi Kashaaya is given. As result solid wastes are purged out enhancing the secretion of urine expel liquid soluble wastes. However, there are toxins in the systems that are fat/lipid soluble. Here the elimination process is more complicated. Unction or Snehapaana is a process where ascending doses of medicated clarified butter or Ghrita is given to the patient for seven consecutive days. The dose is adjusted in such away that on the seventh day the patient consumes no food but only medicated clarified butter and a very small quantity of water. Thus his system gets saturated with lipids and toxins that have affinity to fat, which gets absorbed in the ghee. One or two days later the patient is subjected to sudation whereby the fats containing toxins are brought to the gut. Purgatives such as medicated castor oil, Avipattikara Choorn`a, Trivruta Leha etc are given to induce purgation. Alternatively, emetics are also given when the site of vitiated humor is in the upper part of the gut. But these treatments are aimed to expel the ghee introduced into the system. This purification process relieves chronic skin disorders such as Psoriasis, Ayurvedically a combination of Sidhma and Dadru. In obstinate cases, repeated cleansing as detailed above is required. Medicated ghee such as Tiktaka or Mahaatiktaka is usually used in this process. Allergic disorders encompassing the respiratory system, skin, and gastro intestinal systems etc are directed very frequently in clinical practice. Respiratory disorders arise due to exposure to direct freeze from ceiling or table fans while traveling on the side seats of vehicles such as buses and trains. Exposure of the head to atmosphere during winter season, taking bath when sweating has not subsided naturally, taking oil baths, exposure of head to sun etc can precipitate respiratory allergies such as bronchial asthma, sneezing, stuffy nose, running eyes, sinusitis, unilateral or bilateral headache. A low level of hemoglobin and a deficient Vitamin C level are contributory factors. Consumption of an excess quantity of milk rich in lipid content, consumption of eggs, constipation and a hypersensitive or irritable mental temperament are usually associated with this condition. Ayurveda advises that the diet should be changed as and when he seasons change. Periodic cleansing of the body by purgation at least thrice in a year is a must and the common ma, due to reasons that are obvious, does not heed this advice. Preventing the patient from taking head baths, administration of Kashaayas such as Dasamoolakatutrayaadi, Pathyaashadangam etc, consumption of powders that contain Turmeric, restricting oils that are medicated or plain on the head, covering the head with cotton or woolen garments, relieving the anxiety of the patient with some sedatives or anti-anxiety preparations etc works well to restore the health of the patient. Dry eczema and wet eczema are treated differently. The former variety responds well to unction and external applications of oil. However, in the presence of fever, administration of clarified butter or external applications are contra indicated. In the presence of edema, diuretics are the first option. Unction should be followed with purgation periodically. Prolonged administration of medicated clarified butter should be followed with regular monitoring of Blood pressure, especially in the elderly. Weeping skin lesions are treated with administration of cleansing Kashaayas such as Padoolammlad, Padolakaturohinyaadi or Aargvadhaadi. Here also periodic purging may be necessary. When the vitiated humors are almost cleared from the system, the residual vitiation is stagnated with Kashaayas such as Thikthaka or Mahaathikthaka. When the weeping stops and the lesion becomes dry, pain may be caused due to stretching of the skin. Here only external application of oils is required. Fungal infections of the skin are best relieved with the administration of mediated coconut oil preparations. Sesame oil may aggravate certain fungal lesions, Rubbing of powders also are to be done with caution as some powders may burn the upper strata of the skin or may cause blister formation. Dandruff is not only the problem of adolescence; it is seen to affect all age groups. Predominance is more among the affluent society who consume fats and oils in excess, sweat a lot and neglect hair care. Moisture and dirt retained in between the fingers can give rise to infections, cracking of the skin, painful or burning inflammatory lesions. Allergy to detergent powders also presents a similar picture. Keeping the feet, dry, application of medicated oils, cleaning the affected part with green gram powder usually clears these lesions. However, chronic lesions may require purging. Allergic lesions caused by synthetic or leather footwear are also treated along the same lines. Weeping skin lesions of infants are very common the clinics. The vitiated blood of the mother can give rise to a number of clinical manifestations in infants. Here the treatment is aimed to purify the blood of the mother if the infant is breast-fed. Her diet is adjusted to curb all non-vegetarian food; especially fish, Cathartics and diuretics are administered to the mother. The drugs freely cross the milk barrier and the therapeutic effect is achieved within three to four weeks.

Poorvakarma (Prerequisites): Patient preparation: Diet having Pichchhila (slimy which is Pittaghna) property should be administered beforehand except in cases of As`hmaree, Ars`ha, Bhagandara, Udara and Mukharoga. Pradhaanakarma: For the cauterisation at the level of skin Pippalee, Ajaa S`hakrit, Godanta, S`hara and S`halaakaa should be used. For the cauterisation at the level of Maamsa Dhaatu, Jaambvausht`haadi Loha S`halaakaa should be used. For the cauterisation at the level of Siraa, Snaayu and Asthi; Kshaudra, Gud`a and Sneha should be used. The cauterisation at this level should be done only to stop bleeding and not for any disease at that level, as the diseases involving Siraa, Snaayu and Asthi get cured by cauterisation at the level of Maamsa Dhaatu. The patient should sit facing east or sleep with his/her head towards east. The cauterisation should be done with a heated instrument. A suitable type of the cauterisation should be done depending upon the site. Following are the types Valaya, Ardhachandra, Svastika, Asht`apada, Bindu, Rekhaa, Pratisaaran`a. The cauterisation should be done till the signs and symptoms of Samyak Dagdha appear. Boiling oil should be used if the limb gets separated as in thunder burns or electrical burns. The cauterisation should be done after the Chhedana of big piles in strong patients. Pas`hchaatkarma: Application of honey and cows ghee as general application if patient gets accidental burn. For Sneha Dagdha, Rooksha application should be done and for Rooksha Dagdha, Sneha application should be done. Benefits of Agni Karma: If there is no relief from pain by Snehana and Svedana, Raktamokshan`a should be carried out followed by cauterisation. S`hoola Pras`hamana S.U. 17/94 Gives relief from intense pain due to Vaata situated in Tvak, Maamsa, Siraa, Snaayu, Sandhi and Asthi. The procedure should be repeated till one gets complete relief from pain. Kshaarat Agni Gareeyasi Cauterisation is more effective than the application of Pratisaaran`eeya Kshaara. Apunarbhava Chikitsaa S`hon`ita Aasthaapana Samyak Dagdha Lakshan`a: Adequate Tvak Dagdha Lakshan`a Sound like Chur, bad smell and contraction of skin. Adequate Maamsa Dagdha Lakshan`a Appearance of grey colour, mild pain and mild oedema and wound dries and shrinks. Adequate Siraa and Snaayu Dagdha Lakshan`a Appearance of Krishn`a Varn`a and Unnata(Raised)wound, secretions decrease. Adequate Sandhi and Asthi Dagdha Lakshan`a Wound dries and turns S`hyaama Varn`a, Karkas`ha and Sthira. Other Description: The depth of cauterisation is important. Cauterisation at the depth of skin is for pain in Tvak and Maamsa. Deep cauterisation at the level of Maamsa is for pain in Siraa, Snaayu, Sandhi and Asthi. It can be done even at the level of Siraa, Snaayu, Sandhi and Asthi. Knowledge of Marma sites is very important for the physician who wants to perform cauterisation. In Kritamoola, Mahaavaastu, Kat`hina, Stimita and Guru Kaphaja Gulma cauterisation should be done after blood letting. After S`hastrakarma, cauterisation should be done over Vartmaars`ha, S`hushkaars`ha (Netra Roga) and Arbuda Netra Roga. Cauterisation should be done at the place of Paarshn`i in Atipravriddha Avasthaa of Visoochikaa.

However, when the doshas are out of balance, disease can occur.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of Ayurveda medicine is the use of herbs. Herbs are used to help balance the doshas and promote healing. One of the most common herbs used in Ayurveda is ashwagandha. Ashwagandha is a powerful adaptogen, which means that it helps the body to adapt to stress. It is also a good source of antioxidants, which can help to protect the body from damage.\n\nAnother important aspect of Ayurveda medicine is the use of diet. Ayurveda practitioners believe that the food we eat has a profound impact on our health. They recommend eating a diet that is balanced in all three doshas. This means eating plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. It also means avoiding processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive amounts of meat.\n\nAyurveda medicine is a holistic system of medicine that takes into account the whole person, not just the symptoms of the disease.

The medicated enema administered with medicine in the form of oil. The dose of Anuvaasana Basti is half that of Sneha Basti. During cold season Anuvaasana Basti should be administered during day time. During S`harada, Greeshma and Varshaa Ritu, Anuvaasana Basti should be administered during evening time. If Anuvaasana Basti is to be administered after Nirooha Basti, then it should be administered on the same evening of administration of Nirooha Basti. If Anuvaasana Basti is to be administered after Virechana it should be administered on 7 th day or 9 th day after Virechana. The course of Karma Basti, Kaala Basti and Yoga Basti should begin and end with Anuvaasana Basti. Poorvakarma (Prerequisites): Patient preparation: Abhyanga (Oil massage) Whole body massage particularly over S`hron`ee, Uru, Kat`ee, Sphik and Pakvaas`haya (lower back, thighs, buttocks and abdomen) Application of local fomentation by Taapa Sveda or Avagaaha Sveda or Parisheka Sveda over above mentioned regions.

The meal should be properly cooked. The food items should be according to the disease or Dosha Praadhaanya. I.e. Maamsarasa for Vaata Praadhaanya, Ksheera for Pitta Praadhaanya etc. The quantity of food should be half that of regular quantity. Chankraman`a (walking) should be advised to the patient after meal. Patient should be advised to pass urine and evacuate bowels before administering Basti. This helps in retention of oil in the colon for a longer period. Pradhaanakarma: Basti Pran`idhaana The Bastiput`aka should be attached to the Bastinetra tightly. The Bastiput`aka should be filled with lukewarm prescribed medicine. The quantity of medicine should be such that there should be space to tie the Bastiput`aka easily. Yantran`aa (position of the patient) The patient is asked to lie down on his left side. He should keep his left hand below his head. His left leg should be stretched and right leg should be flexed at the knee and hip joint and should be in front of the abdomen, this relaxes the abdominal wall and the intestinal coils are in their natural position. The anal opening and Basti Netra Mukha are lubricated with ghee or oil. Now days rubber flatus tube is attached to Basti Netra and inserted, instead of directly inserting Basti Netra. The flatus tube or the Basti Netra is inserted slowly and steadily in the direction parallel to the vertebral column. If flatus tube is used then the Basti Netra is connected to the tube. In that case a little more oil than indicated is taken to counter the loss in the flatus tube and Basti Netra. Then the Bastiput`aka should be held in left hand below and right hand above. The patient is advised to inhale slowly and deeply. Then the physician should squeeze the Bastiput`aka evenly and administer the medicine inside the Pakvaas`haya (rectum) steadily with a moderate speed with a steady hand. The physician should not administer all the medicine. He should keep some amount inside the Bastiput`aka to prevent entry of Vaata inside the rectum. Then the physician should immediately remove the tube or Netra gently in one stroke. The patient is advised to lie in supine position for a period of 100 Maatraa. The hands and legs of the patient should be in a stretched out position. Then the patient is given a slightly head low position by rising the legs side of the bed 6 inches. Mild massage should be applied over sole of the patient. Mridu Abhyanga (soft massage) and Mridu Taad`ana (beating) should be applied over buttocks of patient.

Barve MD Kayachikitsa Sus`hruta defines the leech as Jalaukaa and the name arises from the misconception that they are specifically aquatic organisms. Our misconceptions about leech start here and go on and on. The process of blood letting is called as Phlebotomy. Its medicinal application was well known by Ayurveda and it is described in a much scientific way. Among four types of bloodletting described in Ayurveda; three are mechanical and only one the leech is the natural device. As it is a live device; its mechanism of action is much more complicated than Prachchhaana, S`hringa and Alaabu. Considering this scenario; one must try to obtain maximum information about the leech. The word leech comes from an Old English word lacece meaning physician. In 1668 the veterinarian was known as a horse-leech. The spelling later became leech and was used to name a worm used in bloodletting. The leech belongs to the class Hirudinea and phylum Annelida. The technical name for the medicinal leech is Hirudo medicinalis. Leeches are the only annelids with a fixed number (34) of body segments; each segment has secondary subdivisions known as annuli. A clitellum, less conspicuous than that of oligochaetes, is present; there are no parapodia. A leech has a small anterior sucker and a larger posterior one; the leech crawls by moving the anterior sucker forward attaching it, and drawing up the posterior sucker. Most leeches can swim by rapid undulations of the body, using well-developed muscles of the body wall. The blood of some leeches is red. In others the blood lacks oxygen-carrying pigments and is therefore colorless; the oxygen dissolved directly in the blood is sufficient for respiration. Gas exchange occurs through the body surface of most leeches, although many fish parasitizing leeches have gills. The sense organs consist of sensory cells of various types, including photoreceptor cells, scattered over the body surface. There are also 2 to 10 eyes, consisting of clusters of photoreceptor cells and located toward the front of the body. Leech Reproduction: Like the obligochaetes, leeches are hermaphroditic and cross-fertilizing, although fertilization is internal. In some species the sperm are enclosed in sacs, called spermatophores that are attached to the outside of the partner; the sperm pass through the body wall to the ovaries, where the eggs are fertilized. In other species the sperms are not enclosed and are transferred directly into the body of the partner by copulation. A courtship display is seen among some leeches at the time of mating. The fertilized eggs are deposited in a cocoon, secreted by the clitellum; the cocoon is buried in mud or affixed to submerged objects. The young emerge as small copies of the adults. Toxic and medicinal leeches: Medicinal leech has a cylindrical, dorsoventrally flattened body divided into 34 segments. The dorsal side is dark brown to black; bearing 6 longitudinal,, reddish or brown stripes and ventral surface is speckled. The anterior sucker surrounds the oral opening. The medicinal leech has 5 pairs of eyes located in front end. For identifying toxic leeches; Sus`hruta had given appropriate description Krishn`aa Dark black in colour and anterior sucker is larger in size Karbura - Longer in size and instead of stripes on posterior surface, they possess elevated striations. Alagardaa - More black anterior end and broader posterior sucker with hairs on the body. (This may be some other annelida organism, as leeches dont possess cilia on the body surface). Indraayudhaa Multicoloured stripes on the body surface Saamudrika Black body surface with yellowish spots. Gochandana - Bifid posterior sucker. While many aquatic leeches feed on the blood of fishes, amphibians, birds, mammals, snails, insect larvae, and worms. True land leeches feed only on the blood of mammals. Bloodfeeding leeches retain the solid parts of the blood as food in their very large crops, while the leechs kidneys eliminate the blood fluid. A leech can hold up to three times its weight in blood. Parasitic leeches are equipped with a large (caudal) and a small (oral) sucker. The mouth is located on the small sucker and has three jaws with sharp teeth that make a Y- shaped incision in the flesh. When the leech punctures the sin it anesthetizes the wound with its saliva, so that often the victim doesnt feel the puncture. In addition, the leechs saliva dilates the blood vessels to increase blood flow and prevent the blood from clotting. The anticoagulant is called hirudin. Once fulfilled with blood meal, leech takes about 3 to 6 months to digest it. It does not suffer from any disease like Indramada; but becomes useless to suck blood again for so long time. The blood; during this period; is prevented from coagulation and decay or infection. This mechanism is under research. Blood-letting with leeches, and ancient medical practice that fell into disuse in the 19 th century with the growth of pharmaceutical and homeopathic alternatives, has experienced a comeback since the 1980s, when applying leeches to patients after reconstructive surgery was found to help restore blood circulation and acceptance of the grafts. Unless pre-treated with antibiotics, some patients receiving leech therapy suffer infection cased by Aeromonas Veronii, a bacterium that lives in the digestive tract of the leech. George Graf, assistant professor of microbiology uses the leeches to study the interaction between bacteria and their hosts. First, he is trying to understand how the bacteria Aeromonas live in leeches without harming them A second, do the host and the bacterium need to have many different or may similar genes in order to establish a cooperative interaction? Third, he is investigating why the gut of the leech is colonized by a single species of bacteria, and looking for possible anti-microbial agents that may prevent other microorganisms from colonizing the same area. In Sus`hruta immediate turmeric packing at leech bite is not described. S.Su.13/23 I dont make Vran`akarma at bite site immediately. I allow the wound to ooze for 10 15 m, sometimes even half an hour. Local cleaning of the oozing wound with cotton swab is continuous. For single patient, I recycle the leech for bloodletting in same patient. After his treatment is over, I dispose off the leech. I try to avoid cross use of leeches in two different patients. This is a vast subject and needs extensive research as well as interactions in the experts. Dr. Anand B.

If Nirooha Basti is to be administered after Virechana it should be administered after on the 15 th day after Virechana i.e. it should be administered after Anuvaasana Basti. Nirooha Basti can be administered to a patient of any age. Poorvakarma (Prerequisites): Patient Preparation: Abhyanga (Oil massage) whole body massage particularly at S`hron`i, Ooru, Kat`ee, Sphig and Pakvaas`haya (lower back, thighs, buttocks and abdomen) Application of local fomentation by Taapa Sveda or Pot`t`ali Sveda over above mentioned regions. These are mild fomentation and result in increasing circulation to the area and relaxing the abdominal wall and low back postural muscles. This ensures the stay of the Basti in the colon for a longer period. If Anuvaasana Basti is also indicated it should also be administered before. Pradhaanakarma: Basti Pran`idhaana The Bastiput`aka should be attached to the Basti Netra tightly. The Bastiput`aka should be filled with the lukewarm prescribed medicine. The amount of medication should be enough to tie the bladder to the applicator easily and should leave no extra space within. The applicator is plugged securely with a cotton swab till administration to prevent leaks. Yantran`aa (position of the patient) The patient is asked to lie down on his left side. He should keep his left hand below his head as pillow to support the head. His left leg should be stretched and right leg should be flexed at the knee and hip joint and should be in front of the abdomen, this relaxes the abdominal wall and the intestinal coils are in their natural position. The anal opening and Basti Netra Mukha should be lubricated with ghee or oil. Instead of the classical metal or wooden Basti Netra now-a-days rubber flatus tube is used. The flatus tube or the Basti Netra should be inserted slowly and steadily in the direction parallel to the vertebral column. If flatus tube is used then the Basti Netra should be connected to the tube. In that case a little more medicine than indicated is taken to counter the loss in the flatus tube and Basti Netra. Then the Bastiput`aka should be held in left hand below with the thumb facing the patient and right hand above. Both together they should form a cup. The patient should be advised to inhale deeply through mouth throughout the procedure. The plug in the applicator should be deftly removed and re placed with left thumb. Then the physician should squeeze the Bastiput`aka evenly and administer the medicine inside the Pakvaas`haya (rectum) steadily with a moderate speed in one stroke, there should be no strokes, tremors to the hand as it results in movement of the applicator in the rectum and might cause local injury. Some of the medicine should be left in the bladder as it prevents entry of free air in the body which may aggravate the condition. Then the physician should immediately remove the tube or Netra gently. Then the patient is asked to lie down in a supine position with a pillow below his head for 30 Maatraa (nearly minute). Then the patient should sit in a position of Utkat`aasana (squatting position) when he gets the urge to pass stools. It is desired for the Basti to stay in the colon as long as possible in Balya, Vaajeekaran`a and Brimhan`a type of Basti. As colon is the site wherein maximum absorption takes place in shortest period of time. To facilitate this patient should be given a pillow under his lower back and buttocks. Head low position is given by raising the foot side of the bed, mild patting on the buttocks with legs flexed should also done. They help in retaining the Basti for a longer period. The Basti medicine should normally return within 1 Muhoorta (48 minutes). Following are some types of Nirooha Basti used in day to day practice Yaapana Basti This type of Basti cause Yaapana (prolongation of life and support life).This can be administered any time.

Maadhutailika Basti is also an example of this type of Basti. Paadaheena Basti - The Basti which should be administered in the dose of nine Prasrita is termed as Paadaheena Basti. Teekshn`a Basti The Basti which contains Kshaara, Mootra or hot and penetrating Dravya. These Basti can be included in S`hodhana type of Basti.

These can be administered to children and aged people. Pichchhaa Basti This Basti contains Pichchhila Dravya (slimy). These Basti stop the passage of blood or Pichchhila Sraava outside the body. Act as Sangraahee. Utkles`hana Basti These Basti cause Dosha Utkles`hana (precipitation). Doshahara Basti These Basti are Dosha pacifying. Brimhan`a Basti These Basti are strengthening to the body. Pas`hchaatkarma: If the Basti returns immediately without signs of adequacy and feeling of fullness of abdomen persists another Basti then it is to be administered immediately which could be repeated till the signs of adequacy appear. As the Basti medicine is greater in volume and the condition for which Basti is given is occluding in nature there is chance that it would be aggravated, hence it is absolutely essential to ensure the return of Basti within 48 minutes. After Pratyaagama of Basti the patient is asked to rest for a while. Then the patient is asked to take bath with lukewarm water. Then the patient is advised to consume food containing Dhanvamaamsa Rasa (meat soup of animals from dry and arid region), milk and Yoosha considering the strength of Agnee and Dosha.

It becomes imperative in certain conditions to physically remove the sloughs, Dusht`a Tvak (contaminated) skin or hypertrophic muscles from a wound or a lump, at such places Kshaarakarma should be done. Prtisaaran`eeya Kshaara is again divided into three types viz. Mridu, Madhyama and Teekshn`a. Poorvakarma (Prerequisites): Medicine preparation: Madhu, Kaanjee, Dadhi, Dadhi Mastu, Lepa of S`heetaveerya Dravya, Tila Kalka, Yasht`i, Ghrita, Amla Varga, Sauveeraka, Tushodaka, Dhaanyaamla Pradhaanakarma: The procedure should be conducted inside a room free from excessive wind flow and sunlight.

For Pittaja diseases Gharshan`a (rubbing), for Vaataja diseases, Kathin`a and Supta Tvak Lekhana (scrapping) for Kaphaja diseases and when excessive Kan`d`oo and S`hotha is present then Prachchhaana Karma should be done before application of Kshaara. Then Kshaara should be applied with the help of S`halaakaa. Kshaara should be washed off after a time required calculating 100 numbers. (For Kshaara karma at Mridu organs the time should be that equal to calculate 50 numbers.) The site should be covered by a Plota / palm. Pas`hchaatkarma: The site of Kshaarakarma should be flushed with drugs from Amlavarga. Then Lepa of solid part from Sauveeraka, Tushodaka etc. or Tila, Yasht`i should be applied at the site of Kshaarakarma. The patient should be given Abhishyandi Aahaara e.g. Dadhi, Maasha. Due to this there is formation of Kleda at the site of Kshaarakarma and Vilayana of Maamsaadi Dhaatu resulting in Ksharan`a (destruction) of Dhaatu.

This procedure has effect on Kleda. This procedure should not be done when the patient is having multiple wounds. After S`hastrakarma, Kshaarakarma should be done over Vartmaars`ha, S`hushkaars`ha (Netra Roga) and Arbuda Netra Roga. Following is the procedure performed particularly in the treatment of Ars`ha: Poorvakarma (Prerequisites): Instrument checklist: Ars`hoyantra Darvi Koorchaa S`halaakaa Yantra Patient preparation: The patient should eat light diet having Anulomana effect in small amount on the previous night. The patient is not allowed to eat anything on the day of procedure till the end of the procedure. He should be asked to evacuate bowel and pass urine prior to the procedure. The patient should have bath. (The area should be cleaned thoroughly before Kshaarakarma.) Svastivaachana to stabilize the patient psychologically. Medicine preparation: Pratisaaran`eeya Kshaara Mridu Kshaara should be used for Kshaarakarma of Raktapittaja Ars`ha. Pradhaanakarma: Yantranaa positioning The position should lie down in a supine position on a bed or a table with legs spread to expose the anus for better view and to facilitate Kshaarakarma. In case of a child or a serious patient, the patient should lie on the lap of the assistant (in such a manner that the patients body above waist, lies on the lap of assistant.) The patients anus should face east. His waist should be elevated by keeping a pillow below his waist. The patient should be asked to raise his legs and should be given lithotomic position. Then the assistant should apply lubrication to anus and insert lubricated Ars`ha Veekshan`a Yantra, slowly and steadily through the anal opening. Then the patient is asked to do Pravaahan`a (straining). Due to this the Ars`ha will be visible in the Ars`ha Veekshan`a Yantra. The Kshaara should be taken over a Jambvosht`ha S`halaakaa Yantra which is covered by the cloth at one end. The physician should pull the Ars`ha slightly upwards or press the upper part of Ars`ha so that the root of the Ars`ha is visible and apply the Kshaara at the root of Ars`ha. After application of Kshaara the Ars`ha Veekshan`a Yantra should be closed with hand for a time required to count 100 numbers. Then the Kshaara is applied again till the symptoms of proper Kshaarakarma are achieved. When the Ars`ha looks like ripe Jambu or Avasanna (shrinked) or slightly Nata (bent), Kshaara should be washed off with Kaanji, Dadhimastu, S`hukta or Phalaamla Rasa. Then ghee and Yasht`imadhu should be applied. Then the Ars`ho Yantra should be removed gently. Kshaara karma should be done for one Ars`ha at one time. After 7 days Kshaara should be applied to another Ars`ha and so. The Kshaara should be applied to Ars`ha on right side initially then to that on left side, then back and then front. In case of prolapsed piles the Kshaara should be applied without using any instrument. Pas`hchaatkarma: Abhyanga should be done over anus and the area around anus.

The well-known physicians, Charaka and Sus`hruta, have described this Basti under the name Mustaadi Yaapana Basti. Both Charaka and Sus`hruta have used the word Yaapana in various contexts. The different meanings of Yaapana are Dhaaran`am (Maintain; S.Ni. 1:12), Poshan`am (To nourish; S.Su. 14:3) and Roga S`hamanam (to cure a disease; S.Chi.6: 13). Charaka has used it as a synonym for Yaatrakara i.e. supporting life (C.Su. 18:39). Chakrapaan`i has described Yaapanas function as preserving the equilibrium (C.Vi. 1:4 Chakra). These meanings suggest the various functions of Yaapana Basti. Chakrapaan`i mentions, The Basti which supports life and promotes longevity is called Yaapana Basti (C. Si. 12:17, Chakrapaan`i). On account of the variation in action, Aasthaapana Basti is sub-classified as Utkles`hana, S`hodhana etc. Yaapana Basti is also a variety of Aasthaapana Basti; and Maadhutailika, Yuktaratha, Doshahara and Siddha Basti are its synonyms. These synonyms also suggest the nature of these Basti_s (A.S.Su. 28:6) The compound Maadhu Tailika Basti is so called from the fact of its being principally composed of Madhu (Honey) and Taila (Oil). Yuktaratha owes its name to the fact of its imposing no restriction as regards riding in carriages, on horses and elephants after its administration. Siddha Basti derives its name from the uniform success, which applies to its application in a large number of cases of bodily distempers and from its irresistible power in improving the strength and complexion of the body. Actions of Yaapana Basti: The Yaapana Basti eliminates the Dosha_s accumulated in the body, improves strength and complexion and shown highly beneficial therapeutic effects (Su.Chi. 38:39). Yaapana Basti_s are designated longevity promoters. They are promoters of Maamsa, S`hukra and strength. It cures all the diseases and is suitable in all seasons (C.Si.12). It induces fertility in sterile women and men. Yaapana Basti_s impose both the properties Lekhana as well as Brimhan`a. Thus they are formed to serve the purpose of both types of enema namely Nirooha and Anuvaasana (A.S.K.26). Hence, though these are mentioned as a variety of Sthaapana Basti, they do not require the administration of Anuvaasana Basti, in their causes. They possess Vrishya property and are also the best in Vaajikaran`a drugs. Yaapana Basti_s can be administered to the diseased as well as the healthy. They can be resorted to with respect to Kings or King-like persons as well as to women, aged, and infants and also in persons of delicate constitutions. These are recommended in persons of easy and luxurious habits as well as in persons of Mridukosht`ha. Persons habituated daily to be treated with Emulsive measures (Sneha Karma) and in that accumulation of Dosha_s are less may also be safely given Yaapana Basti. Yaapanbasti are promotive of S`hukra and Maamsa. So they can be used in the diseases of their Srotas like Klaibya, Aharsha etc. and Arbuda, Apachi. Etc. It is a special treatment of Klaibya (C.Chi. 30/203, 204) Yaapana Basti_s are indicated in degenerative disorders as well as in diseases due to ageing. Yaapana Basti_s are beneficial in condition of Sarva Dhaatvaavritta Vaata. Contra Indications: There are no major contra-indications mentioned specifically for Yaapana Basti. Being a type of Nirooha, contraindications of Nirooha Basti should also be considered as the contra indications of Yaapana Basti. Sus`hruta has advised not to administer Yaapana Basti in case of indigestion (S.Chi. 38:113) Pathya for Yaapana Basti: Asht`aanga Hridayam has advised the intake of food with milk medicated by Aatmaguptaa, S`hveta Gunjaa, and Taalimakhaanaa during the course of Siddha type of Yaapana Basti. Apathya for Yaapana Basti: While describing Maadhutailika Basti, Sus`hruta opines that the use of this remedy does not entail any strict observance of continence or of any particular rule, diet, conduct or conveyance on the part of the patient. (S.Chi.38: 98). However some proper rules of diet and conduct should be observed, e.g. day sleep should not be indulged in, after being treated with a Basti (S.Chi. 38:113). Siddha Basti, another variety of Yaapana, does not entail any strict observance of the regimen of diet and conduct. D`alhan`a further comments that these Basti_s do not require, previous administration of emetics and purgatives etc. (S. Chi. 38:118, D`alhan`a Commentary) Charaka advices avoidance of certain activities. He prohibits, exercise, sex act, alcohol, honey, cold water, excessive eating and jolty conveyances during the course of these enemas. Retention of Yaapana Basti: Yaapana Basti is Mridu in nature and hence retain for a long-time than any ordinary Basti (K.Khi. 8:69). However being a variety of Aasthaapan Basti, it must come out of the body after a certain amount of time and should not be retained. If, on account of some mild action, these Basti_s are not thrown out, then a corrective enema with strong (Teeskshn`a) medication mixed with cows urine should be administered. The Teekshn`a Basti cannot retain for more than, at a time, a hundred Maatraa_s and brings out the previous retained one along with it also. Complications of Excessive Yaapana Basti: Yaapana Basti_s being mild in potency neither produces any distress or discomfort nor excessive reaction or under action (C.Si.12: 29). But the long-term excessive use of these enemas causes S`hotha, loss of Agni, Paan`d`u, S`hoola, Ars`ha, Parikartikaa, Jvara and Atisaara. (C.Si.12: 30; A.S.K.5: 16). Bhela has added Vibhrama in the list of complications (Bhel. Si. 8) To combat these complication Deepaneeya drugs in the form of Arisht`a, Ksheera, Sidhu etc. should be used. Therefore one should take recourse to these Basti_s judiciously and not as a matter of habit. Significance of various contents of Yaapana Basti: Various contents of Yaapana Basti are as follows: Saindhava, Madhu, Ghrita, Kalka, Madanaphala, Ksheera, Kvaatha and Maamsarasa. Each of these plays a certain role in the action of the Basti and hence is mixed in a certain fixed proportion. The action of Saindhava and other contents of Basti can be divided under two headings viz. outside the body and inside the body i.e. action of one content with that of another, outside the body which may produce some changes in the physio-chemical properties of Basti; and another is the action of those contents on the body. All salts (Lavan`a) are Vishyandi, Sookshma, Teekshn`a, Ushn`a and Vaataghna, in nature. They promote evacuation of the bladder and the rectum (A.H.Su.6:143) All these properties exist in Saindhava also. Besides, it is Madhur in trace, Vrishya, and eliminates all the three Dosha_s, it is Laghu and slightly Ushn`a, but doesnt cause Vidaaha and is Deepana. Action on the body: Because of its Vishyandi property it separates the particles and thus reduces the compactness and density (Samghaata) of Styaana Kapha (A.H.Su.6: 143) On account of its Sookshma property it can go into the micro-channels of the body. Thus the molecules of the other contents of Basti if bound with Saindhava may also reach Up to carrier, and helps to reach the Basti to a deep level. Saindhava liquefies and segregates the Kapha in the body (C. K.1: 15). It also liquefies the accumulated morbid matter therein by virtue of its Ushn`a property and breaks it up by its Teekshn`a property. As it promotes the evacuation the broken and liquefied morbid matter is expelled out (C. S. 25:43) and hence Basti isnt retained inside and come out after a certain time The role of Saindhava outside the body: while preparing the Basti. Saindhva destroys the Picchila, Bahula and Kashaaya properties of Madhu and produces a close union with it (K.Khi.8: 41) Importance of Quantity of Saindhava: Absence or less quantity of Saindhava is responsible for Ayoga i.e. under action of Basti whereas in excess quantity it produces Daaha (burning sensation) and Atisaara (A.H. 19:42, Hridaya  Bodhikaa Comm.) Madhu (Honey): Honey is both sweet and astringent in taste: Rooksha, S`heeta, Laghu in Gun`a and is Deepan, Varn`ya, Svarya, Lekhana, Hrudya, Vaajikaran`a, Sandhaanakara, S`hodhana, Ropan`a and Prasaadana in properties. It has the capacity to go through micro channels. Because of its Laghu Gun`a it eliminates Kapha. By virtue of its Pichchhila Gun`a and sweet and astringent tastes, it eliminates Vaata and Pitta. Thus it is Tridosha Prashamana in nature (S.Su.45: 132) According to Charaka, honey is the provocative of Vaata, Guru, S`heeta, curative of Rakta Pitta and Kapha disorders. As honey is composed of various substances, it is the smoothest vehicles (C.Su.27: 249) Role of honey in the body: Honey being the best vehicle and possessing the capacity to go through micro channels, increases the potency of the Basti drugs. This also carries the drug to the molecular level. Basti when combined with honey makes a man extremely virile. Basti with honey does not lead to over action or under action (C.Si. 12). Ghrita (Sneha): Ghrita is Saumya in its essence and potency and is Mridu and Madhura. It doesnt cause defluxions. It is Agni Deepana and subdues Vaata and Pitta. It improves memory. Intelligence, complexion, voice, personal beauty and Ojas in the body. It is Vitalizing, Rejuvenating, Vrishya Medhya and Promoter of long life(Vayasthaapana). It eliminates toxic substances from the body (S.Su.45: 96). It is the best of the unctuous substances. There is no other such material, which imbibes the quality of drugs to the extent that Ghee does (Samskaaranuvartana) and is Yogavaahi. It is the best Rasaayana. Addition of Ghrita or any Sneha makes for a homogenous mixture. Thus these three Saindhava_s, Madhu and Ghrita together act to make Basti a homogenous mixture. They promote, the qualities of the drug and carry it to the micro channels. Sometimes the drug by itself cannot reach to the molecular level. At that time the Virya or qualities of the drug are carried by Ghrita because of its Samskaaranuvartana property. Kalka Kvaatha and Aavaapa: These are selected according to the conditions of Dosha and Dhaatu_s and with certain anticipation Regarding the functions of Basti. Kalka serves the functions of Utkles`hana or Doshaharan`a or Sams`haman depending on its contents and are thus selected accordingly. It also gives the required thickness to the Basti material. Less quality or absence of Kalka makes Basti too thin, which cannot be retained in the body for a longer period of time. Excess quantity of Kalka makes Basti viscous and difficult to administer. Thicker Basti cannot be ousted in the expected time. Aavaapa drugs are used to make the Basti either more strong or mild. They are mixed by considering the expected action on Dosha e.g. Amlakaanjee is mixed to eliminate Nirupasthambhi Vaata. Kshaara makes Basti strong and effective in eliminating the Kapha. Aavaapa drugs should not be harmful to the Dhaatu_s. Kvaatha drugs are the main part of the Basti and are selected to serve specific functions e.g. drugs of Vidaareegandhaadigan`a are used for Brimhan`a. Vyaadhipratyanika drugs should be used in the Kvaatha. Pakvaas`haya is the seat of Basti drug. It spreads all over the body, eliminates Dosha_s and performs its functions by staying in Pakvaas`haya. Hence a few drugs in Kvaatha and Kalka are added to give strength to Pakvaas`haya and to enable it in promoting the action of the Basti drug. A weak Pakvaas`haya cannot retain the Basti. So while selecting the drugs, status of Pakvaas`haya like Mridu etc. should be thought of. Contents of Raajayaapana Basti: Raajayaapana Basti is a homogenous mixture of milk decoction, Rock salt, honey, ghee, Kalka and Mutton soup. Kvaatha: The ingredients of Kvaatha are Mustaa, Paathaa, Gud`oochi, Eran`d`a, Balaa, Raasnaa, Punarnavaa, Manjisht`haa, Aaragvadha, Us`heera, Traayamaan`a, Laghupanchamoola, Bibheetaka, and Kut`akee. Each one should be one Pala in quantity. Madanaphala eight in number, are also added to the decoction. Kalka: Kalka contains Yasht`imadhu, Mishreyaa, Trivruta, Indrayava and Rasaanjana. Method of preparation: Sus`hruta has described the method of preparation in detail, which is further explained by D`alhan`a. The method is as follows: One Pala (40 gms) of each of the ingredients of Kvaatha and eight fruits of Madana (8fruits =12 Pala) should be boiled in an Aad`haka (512 ml) of water down to its quarter part. As the quantity should be doubled in cases of fresh vegetables and fluids (Su.Chi.31: 17), D`alhan`a has counted an Aad`haka equal to a hundred and twenty eight Pala (5120 ml) i.e. exactly double its normal quantity (S.Chi. 38:106-111 D`alhan`a Comm.) The decoction thus prepared, comes to thirty-two Pala (1280 ml). This should again be boiled with the admixture of half Aad`haka i.e. sixty-four Pala_s (2560 ml) of milk. The boiling should be continued till the watery part has completely evaporated and the quantity of milk alone has left. It should be strained through a piece of cloth. Quarter Prastha i.e. eight Pala_s (320 ml) of Maamsa Rasa is added to it. Thus the total mixture comes to seventy-two Pala_s (2880 ml). Yaapana Basti is a type of Nirooha Basti, therefore for one Put`a of Basti, twenty four Pala_s out of seventy two should be taken.  A Karsha (10 gms) of Saindhava and one and half Prasrita_s (3Pala i.e. 120 ml) of Madhu should be taken, separately and mixed well with the help of pestle and mortar so that it should become a paste. Ghrita in an equal quantity of Madhu should be admixtured with it. Kalka is prepared with the earlier said ingredients in quantity of one Karsha each. One and half Pala (60 gms) of the Kalka and half Pala (20 Gms) Madanphala powder should be mixed in a mixture of Ghee and honey. The total mixture should be then mixed thoroughly with the mixture of milk decoction and Maamsa Rasa. This final product is termed as Raajayaapana Basti. The maximum dose of this Basti, at a time, is thirty-two Pala_s i.e. approximately one litre and two eighty ml. According to Paaraas`hara (Quoted by D`alhan`a on S.Chi. 38:106-111) the lowest dose of Nirooha is three Kud`ava, i.e. forty-eight Tola_s. This is the quantity of mixture of the milk decoction and Maamsa Rasa. Honey, Ghee and Kalka are added proportionately which in total becomes six hundred and forty ml. Hence in this study we administered a total six hundred and forty ml quantity of Basti at a time, which is the lowest measure for this Basti. Indications for Raajayaapana Basti: The application of this Basti cures Vaata Rakta, Prameha, S`hotha, Ars`ha, Gulma, Purisha and Mootravibandha, Visarpa, Jvara, Raktapitta. It is Balya, Vrishya and rejuvenating to the body (S.Chi.38:106-111). It is a promoter of Agni, Maamsa and S`hukra. It cures Moha, Vardhma, Aadhmaana, Pravaahikaa, and relieves pain in Kat`i, Manyaa, S`hira, S`hrotra, Vankshan`a, Ura and Kukshi. It also cures Asrigdara, Unamaada, Kaasa, As`hmaree and Bastikundala. It is the king of Yaapana and is the best Rasaayana (A.S.K.5) Characteristics of a well-prepared Basti: Chakradatta has described the characteristics of a well-prepared Basti as follows: A well-prepared Basti should not run quickly out of the hand, nor should it coat or stay on the hands. It should be a uniform mixture without separation or partition (Simanta), between its contents (Chakradatta with S`hivadaasa Sen Comm.) Dr.Manoj Nesari Sr.Scientist AyuSoft.

So for, Post Graduation study, the topic of Utkles`han Basti was selected. The main aim of the study was \"To specify the exact conditions of Utkles`han`a Basti and to ascertain the mode of its action. The study revealed significant results. The term Utkles`ha and Utkles`han`a =i\u00c9\u00c2 + \u00caK\u00fa\u00b6\u00c9\u00c2 >\u00f8v\u00b4\u00c9\u00c7i\u00c9& +\u00c9n\u00fc\u00d4E\u00fa\u00c9\u00aeE\u00e4\u00fa K\u00e4\u00fan\u00fcE\u00fa\u00c9\u00aeE\u00e4\u00fa * \u00b4\u00c9\u00c9S\u00c9\u00ba{\u00c9i\u00aa\u00c9\u00a8\u00c9\u00c2 To excite, to agitate Utkles`ha - excitement, agitation Utkles`haka - Causing disorder of Dosha. Ulkleshya-Prakopya (Dalhan`a S. Su. 20/20) 'Utlkes`ha' means provocation or accentuation of Dosha. Utklisht`ya Sthaanaat Chalitah (A.H.Su. 18/12 Hemaadri) Dosha get agitated from the sites they usually occupy. Anuklisht`aan Svasthaanaat Achalitaana (A.H.Su13/28 Sarvaangasundera) The word Anutklisht`a means Dosha are in their own site but are lurking and not separated from their site. To Summarize: Utkles`ha is a very specific condition of Dosha. The prefix Ut indicates movements which is in upward direction. Upward movement or direction is with respect to specific site i.e. from the site. The verbal phrase Chalita indicates movement regarding Moorta Dosha. So the phenomenon of Utkles`han`a is possible in case of Moorta Dosha i.e. Kapha and Pitta. Vaata is an important force for the movement. There are two phrases 'Utkles`ha' and 'Upasthita' seem to be similar: Utkles`ha - For S`haakhagata or Madhyama Maarga Gata Dosha Utkles`han`a means provocation or agitation of Dosha from their site in S`haakha or Madhyama Maarga. The movement of Dosha takes place from S`haakha or Madhyama Maarga towards Kosht`ha. This movement can be termed as 'Utkles`ha'. Thus the separated Dosha leave their site in S`haakha or Madhyama Maarga and occupy the site in Kosht`a i.e. Upasthita Doshatva. Here movement of Dosha from one organ in Kosht`a to other organ in Kosht`a can be considered. Some times Dosha present in the Kosht`a show excitement and tend to move outside the body or they show spontaneous elimination from Kosht`a to outside the body. E.g. Chhardi, Aamaatisaara. This movement is termed as Utkles`ha of Dosha in Kosht`a i.e. Upasthita Dosha. 'Utkles`han`a' can take place by: Utkles`haka Aahaara. Specific Kaala Different treatment procedures (Snehana, Svedana etc., Basti is one of them). Unpleasant subjects. Unsuccessful purification method. The mode of Utkles`ha of Dosha in all above conditions does differ as per following parameters: Amount of Utklisht`a Dosha. Site of affliction. Direction of Utkles`han`a. Period of Utkles`ha. Constituents of Utkles`han`a Basti: (Reference: S.Chi. 38/92) Eran`da Beeja, Yasht`ee, Pippali, Vachaa, Hapushaa Prakshepa: Madhu, Saindhava, Madanaphala Drugs and Bhoutika Constitution: Eran`da Beeja(Prithvi + Agni): Rasa: Madhura, Kat`u, Kashaaya Veerya: Ushn`a Vipaaka: Madhura Properties: Guru, Teekshn`a, Svedopaga, Sookshma Action: Svedopaga, Bhedana Prabhaava - Adhobhaagahara Pureeshadhara Pakvaas`haya Uttaraguda Adharaguda Sthoolaantra Yasht`ee(Prithvi + Aapa) : Rasa: Madhura Veerya: S`heeta Vipaaka: Madhura Properties: Guru, Snigdha Action: Vamanopaga, Kaphavilayana, Raktastambhana,Hridya(\u00be\u00fet) Pippali(Agni + Vaayu): Rasa: Kat`u Veerya: Anushn`a- S`heeta (Ushn`a - According to Charak) Vipaaka: Madhura Properties: Laghu, Snigdha, Teekshn`a, Aas`hukaari, Yogavaahi Action: Rechana, Deepana, Chardana,Rasaayana Vachaa(Agni + Vayu): Rasa: Tikta, Kat`u Veerya: Ushn`a Vipaaka: Kat`u Properties: Laghu, Teekshn`a, Sara, Pramathi, Aashukaari Action: Emesis, Liquefying Kapha, Lekhana Hapushaa(Due to unavailability not used in Basti): Rasa: Tikta, Kat`u, Kashaaya Veerya: Ushn`a Vipaaka: Kat`u Properties: Guru, Mridu Action - Deepana, Anulomana, Bhedana Prakshepa: Madhu: Rasa: Madhura, Kashaaya Veerya: S`heeta Vipaaka: Madhura Properties: Sookshma, Rooksha, Yogavaahi Action: Deepana, Srotomukhavis`hodhana, Lekhana 2) Saindhava(Agni + Jala): Rasa: Lavan`a, Madhura Veerya: Anushn`a Vipaaka: Madhura Properties: Sookshma, Laghu, Sara, Teekshn`a Action: Deepana, Paachana, Chedana, Bhedana,Kledana, Sramsana 3) Madanaphala (Agni + Vayu) : Rasa: Madhura,Tikta, Kashaaya Veerya: : Ushn`a Vipaaka: Kat`u Properties: Laghu, Rooksha, Vikaasee, Vyavaayi, Aas`hukaari Action: Lekhana, Vaamaka Prabhaava - Vaamaka Basti Kalpanaa: Sus`hruta has given Utkles`han`a Basti as Nirooha Basti Kalpana. He intended to use the three Basti - Utkles`han`a, Doshahara and Dosha S`hamana in sequence. (S.Chi.38/91). Thus it can be inferred that Utkles`han`a Nirooha according to Sus`hruta is expected to be used for Utkles`han`a of Kosht`hagata Dosha and it should be followed by Doshahara and Dosha S`hamana. There is one opinion in the commentary made by Dalhan`a that the Basti does not cause Utkles`han`a of Dosha situated in Dhaatu (tissues) (Dalhan`a Su.Chi. 38) But to observe the results in patients of Bahudosha Avasthaa and S`haakhagata Dosha, Basti was used as Nirooha and Anuvaasana Basti. From above opinion of Dalhan`a, it can be inferred that, Sus`hruta has expected Kalka / Aavaapa of Dravya [Eran`dabeeja, Yasht`i, Pippali, Vacha, Madanphala] in hot water. Hence Kalka in hot water will not be used for Utkles`han`a at tissue level / Dhaatu level. It will act in Pakvaas`haya and will cause Utkles`han`a of Pakvaas`hayagata Dosha. But for Gun`otkarsha, Karmotkarsha and to see the effect all over the body (i.e. Dosha, Dhaatu, Mala, Agni, Srotas), decoction and Siddha Taila (processed oil) was used. Here one thing should be noted that due to decoction and Siddha Sneha Utkles`han`a of Dhaatugata Dosha can be seen e.g. in Aamavaata, S`hotha. These changes are mentioned in the thesis. For the purpose of Gun`otkarsha and Karmotkarsha, decoction of the above drugs was used. For Anuvaasana sesame oil processed with the above drugs (Siddha Sneha) was used according to Snehapaaka Vidhi as per S`haarangadhara Samhita. Nirooha - Dose - Decoction 320 ml (Pippali, Eran`dabeeja, Vacha, Yasht`i, Kalka - 5 gm each drug in fine powder form, Oil 30 ml, Honey 30 ml, Saindhava 5 gm ). Anuvaasana - Processed oil 60 ml was used. Action of Utkles`han`a Basti: General Action Specific Action Collectively Utkles`han`a Basti has: Rasa - Kat`u , Tikta Veerya Ushn`a Vipaaka - Kat`u Gandha - Utkles`haka Properties Ushn`a, Sookshma, Teekshn`a, Laghu, Saandra, Pramathi, Snigdha, Vyavayi, Vikaasee Functions - According to the principle Utkles`han`a Basti will perform function like Langhana, Rookshan`a, Svedana and Snehana. Other function - Chedana, Bhedana, Lekhana. Action of Utkles`hana Basti - Action on Dosha and Dhatu : Dosha- Kaphavilayana, Pittavriddhi, Activation of Vaata. Dhatu - Final Action / Ultimate result. Rasa: Increase in Fluidity and Subtleness.Decrease in Unctuousness. Rakta: Increase in Fluidity and Saragun`a (spreading) Maamsa: Decrease in Hardness and Heaviness. Meda: Increase in Fluidity (S`haithilya). Asthi: Increase in Dryness. Majja: Decrease in Softness. S`hukra: Increase in Fluidity. Decrease in Unctuousness. Upadhaatu : Raja - Fluidity, Hotness Tvak - Softness Srotas - Upalepa, Sanga, Vimaargagamana - Eliminated Kaala - Purification of Pureeshadhara, Maamasadhara, Asthidhara, Majjaadhara, Pittadhara kalaa Agni - Deepana Mala Purisha - Bhedana, Malakshaya Mootra - Increase in Fluidity, Hotness, Quantity Sveda Pravrutti Action: Utkles`han`a Basti with Vyavaayi and Vikaasee attributes In Pakvaas`haya Nipaata / Samparka with body constituents Properties responsible for rapid diffusion of drugs in body] Pakvaas`haya, Grahan`ee and Rasagaami - Rasa flows in Oordhva, Adha and Tiryak direction and three Maarga Veerya of Basti - is first taken by Apaana Vaayu, then Samaana and then Vyaana Vaayu and in whole body Through Rasa drug can reach Dusht`a Srotas (afflicted tissues) Due to Vikasee, Pramathi etc. properties, adhesion of Dosha are broken down (Until now function occurs irrespective of Jaat`haraagni) Other properties - (Sookshma, Ushn`a, Teekshn`a etc.) act with respect to Jaat`haraagni Pakvaas`hayastha Agni - activated by Jaat`haraagni Paachana of drug occurs Drug circulates through Rasa This requires time hence Dhaaran`a kaala is important Through 'Rasa' drug reaches Dusht`a Srotas From specific Dusht`a Srotas Lekhana, Bhedana of Dosha occurs Separated Dosha move along Rasa Reach Kosht`ha Show excitement in upward direction with respect to Kosht`ha or Show excitement in downward direction with respect to Kosht`ha Here 'Pramaathi' property along with Vyavaayi, Vikaasee etc. is very important. The drug is capable of converting and eliminating vitiated and strongly harbored Dosha from various body constituents (also deep body constituents) due to their potency. For this it does not require any assistance from Jaat`haraagni. S`harangadhara Samhita-Paribhaasha. Thus, Utkles`han`a Basti indications are: Dosha- Vruddha Dosha a. Bahu b. Madhyama Avasthaa Anutklisht`a Leena Aama Gati S`haakha to Kosht`ha Kosht`ha to Kosht`ha Madhyama - Maarga Dooshya - Rasa, Maamsa, Meda, Asthi Srotas- Annavaha; Pureeshavaha Mootravaha Udakavaha Rasavaha Maamsavaha Medavaha Asthivaha Events - Sanga Sanga and Vimaargagamana Vyaadhi Santarpan`ottha Selection of Patients: Dosha Sanchaya is the common factor in the Vyaadhi like Aamavaata, S`hotha, S`hvaasa. So these were selected for the research. But the Sampraapti Ghat`aka in these Vyaadhi are different. e.g. Aamavaata - Upalepa S`hotha Srotorodha Role of Utkles`hana Basti in Aamavaata : Aamavaata is debilitating disease in view of its chronicity (Chirakaaritva) & complications (Upadrava). There is variety of patients (one can classify like Bahudosha, Alpa Dosha, Puraan`a, Nava, Saamanyalakshan`a, Prakupita Aamavaata, Aamapradhaana Aamavaata , etc.) Various treatments have been given for Aamavaata which are to be used as per Avasthaa = stage of the disease. The guiding principles of S`hodhana are: (1) Bahudoshaavasthaa (2) Utkles`ha and Upasthita Doshatva. Precipitation of Dosha from S`haakhaa to Kosht`ha and presence of Dosha in the Kosht`ha is necessary before purification. (C.VI. 3/44, C.S. 2/15) In Aamavaata for Saama Dosha and S`haakhagata Dosha, different ways of precipitation of Dosha (Utkles`h a) are given in A.H.S. 13/18, 19, 30 But we cannot follow the same principle in all conditions. E.g.: (1) Patients with less vitality. (2) Akaala - Kaala Mithyaayoga etc. (3) Strong obstruction in channels (Balavan Srotorodha) Here Utkles`han`a Basti plays important role for achieving Utkles`han`a and Upasthita Doshatva. Twenty cases diagnosed as Aamavaata were studied during research. Classification of patients: Bahudosha - 9 patients Madhyamadosha - 8 patients. Alpadosha - 3 patients. Saamanya Lakshan`a - 3 patients. Prakupita Aamavaata - 17 patients. Method of using Basti: Utkles`han`a Nirooha and Anuvaasana Basti were given alternately on the same day for 4 to 7 days. Sampraapti of Aamavaata : Dosha- Vaata, Kapha Dooshya - Agni, Rasa. Sanchara - All S`hlesmasthaana - Aamashaya, Sandhi, Ura, Rasa etc. Adhishthana - Sandhi Samprapti Ghat`ana - Abhishyanda in Srotas (Upalepa). Results: Oordhva Utkles`ha - 4 Vamana Adha Utkles`ha - 15 Doshahara Basti. No Utkles`ha - 1 Four patients showed Oordhava Utkles`ha after administration of five Basti. Symptoms like Hrillasa, Praseka, Udara Gaurava, Kshudhaamaandya were seen. On examination, there was Aamaas`haya Gaurava. Hence Vamana with Panchatiktaka Kvaatha was given. This relieved 40% to 60% of Symptoms. For remaining Dosha, Doshahara and Doshas`hamana Basti were administered. Twelve patients (Bahudosha - 6 patients, Madhyamadosha - 6 patients) showed aggravation of S`haakhagata Symptoms after administration of 5 to 6 Basti which signifies Doshavriddhi. After administration of next 4 to 6 Basti, there was relief of symptoms which signifies S`haakha to Kosht`a Gati of Dosha and elimination of Dosha. Chart: Three patients after administration of seven Basti showed decrease in signs and symptoms upto 80%. A short course of Doshahara and Doshas`hamana Basti was given after this. When the Dosha move in upward direction, there is Oordhva Utkles`h a. When the Dosha move in downward direction, there is Adha Utkles`h a. Symptoms are Udara Gaurava, Malavriddhi and Sakapha Mala Pravrutti. Utkles`hana Nirooha Basti causes purification of Dosha along with Doshahara Basti, thus - (1) As Utkles`hana Basti is a Basti Kalpana, it has primary action of Vaata Dosha and on Vividhagati (movements of Vaata). (2) Drugs in Basti bring about action primarily due to Veerya. Basti has fact action and is very effective (Aas`hukaa`ri). (3) In Aamavaata there is vitiation of Vaata and Agni and Basti has direct action on Agni and Moolasthaana of Vaata, Rasavaha Srotas, Pureeshadhara Kalaa, Asthidhara Kalaa and Majjadhara Kalaa. (4) Aama is Guru and naturally Adhogaami and its elimination by Basti is natural. Hence AdhaUtkles`ha was commonly found. As Nirooha Basti Kalpana is important in view of S`hodhana, Dosha are eliminated by Utkles`han`a Basti. Thus Basti revealed good results in all stages of Aamavaata Patients were followed for one year. In most of the cases recurrence was hard to find. Role of Utkles`hana Basti in treatment of S`hotha: S`hotha is one of the common diseases. Charaka has expounded a wide range of causative factors for Nija S`hotha (C-Chi-12/5, 6). The treatment principle of S`hotha is given according to the cause and condition of S`hotha. E.g.: Condition Treatment Aamaja S`hotha  Paachana Snehabhava S`hotha  Virookshan`a C.Ch.12/8 Bahudoshaja S`hotha  S`hodhana Langhana Langhana, Paachana Doshaavasechana C.Su.23/8,9 We have already seen that Utkles`han`a Basti has attributes to do the above functions like Pachana, Rukshana, Shodhana, Lekhana etc. Hence Utkles`han`a Basti was tried in Nija S`hotha as Vyaadhi Pratyaneeka Chikitsaa. Method of using Basti: It was same as Aamavaata . Classification of patients: 18 patients of Nija S`hotha were selected. Bahudosha Avasthaa - 14 patients. Madhyam Dosha Avasthaa - 4 patients. Chirakaari S`hotha - 1 patient. Nava S`hotha - 17 patients. Results: Urdhva Utkles`ha - 5 patients. Adha Utkles`ha - 13 patients. Five patients of Bahudosha Avasthaa showed Urdhva Utkles`ha after administration of seven Basti. Out of these five patients, two patients showed symptoms like Hrullaasa, Praseka, Kshudhaamaandya, Arati, S`hiro Gaurava and Chhardi. In Chhardi contents were Pichhila Kapha and Pitta. As there was no total elimination of Dosha, the patients were given Doshahara Basti and S`hamanaChikitsaa. Another three patients also showed symptoms of Urdhava Utkles`ha. Hence Sadyo Vamana was given with Panchatikta Kvaatha. After Vamana the S`hotha was reduced upto 60%. One patient, after administration of six Utkles`hana Basti, showed Adhara Utkles`h a Prabhoota AdhoVaatasaran`a with 6 to 7 Dravamala Vega_s (loose motions). Then the S`hotha was reduced. Twelve patients showed specific S`haakha to Kosht`ha Gati of Dosha. After administration of 5 to 6 Basties, Shakha gata symptoms were aggravated which signifies Doshavriddhi and after administration of next 5 to 6 Basti there was relief of symptoms about 60% to 70%. This signified S`haakha to Kosht`hagati of Dosha and elimination of Dosha by Adha Marga. Conclusion: In S`hotha Doshaachayajanya Srotorodha is the main Sampraapti Ghat`ana. Basti Kalpana has main action on Vaata Dosha. It has fast action and is very effective. Utkles`han`a Basti eliminates Doshasanchaya from S`haakha and Kosht`ha by it's Ushn`a (hot), Sookshma (Subtle) and Pramathi properties. Hence Srotorodha gets eliminated and Vaatanulomana occurs. Thus Sampraaptibheda of S`hotha takes place. Hence Utkles`han`a Basti is useful in Nija S`hotha - KaphaVaataja S`hotha, Vaatakaphaja, Kaphaja, Santarpan`ajanya, Snehabhaava and Aamaja S`hotha . In this research Kaphaja and Santarpanajanya S`hotha were found and observed, But more work is to be done for Snehabhaava, Aamaja etc. types of S`hotha . Patients were followed for one year. Three patients showed recurrence with less intensity. The Basti was also tried in S`hvaasa. It was used as a Poorvakarma of Vamana along with Snehapaana. It revealed positive significant results.

S`hresht`ha Gun`ayukta i.e. the Basti having best properties and effects is termed as Uttara Basti.  In female the Uttara Basti should be administered during Ritukaala (proliferative phase) only. The Uttara Basti in female should never be administered before her menarche. Poorvakarma (Prerequisites): Patient Preparation: The patient should be advised to consume Yavaagu, milk and ghee or meal containing Maamsarasa on the previous night. The patient should be advised to pass urine and stools before the procedure. Then Abhyanga (oil massage) should be done over buttocks, lower back, and waist and groin regions. Pradhaanakarma: The procedure of Uttara Basti in males:- The patient should sit on a stool of knee height. Then oil massage should be applied over penis. Then a bladder sound should be inserted slowly and the approximate length up to the bladder should be assessed. Then it should be removed out slowly. Then the Basti Netra or rubber catheter should be inserted steadily and gently after lubricating it. When the catheter reaches bladder then syringe should be attached to the other end and the indicated lukewarm medicine should be injected with a moderate speed. Then the catheter should be removed gently. The procedure of Uttara Basti in female:- The female should be advised to lie down on a table. Then she should be given the lithotomy position. Oil massage should be applied over groin region. If the Uttara Basti is to be administered in bladder then the probing should be done with the help of bladder sound and if it is to be administered in uterus, probing should be done with the help of uterine sound. Then Basti Netra or suitable lubricated rubber catheter should be inserted steadily. When the Uttara Basti is to be administered inside uterus the cervical oss should be held with the Sandams`ha Yantra (vulsellum) and then the catheter should be inserted. Uterine canula can be used instead of catheter. The syringe should be attached to the other end and then the lukewarm medicine should be injected with moderate speed. Then the catheter or Basti Netra should be removed gently. If the medicine of Uttara Basti is in decoction form then the medicine comes out immediately after injection. If the medicine of Uttara Basti is in the form of oil, then some amount of oil comes out immediately and the remaining part gets absorbed or comes out slowly after some time. Pas`hchaatkarma: If Uttara Basti material does not come out after 12 or 24 hours then suitable Varti should be administered to achieve Basti Pratyaagama. In some cases the Uttara Basti may cause severe pain. To overcome this pain Vedanaahara medicine (Nidrodaya Rasa, Ahiphenaasava) should be administered after administering Uttara Basti. After Basti Pratyaagama the patient should be advised to consume meal containing milk, Yoosha and Maamsarasa. Other Description: Now a days syringe, rubber catheter or uterine canula is used instead of Uttara Basti Yantra. The dose of Uttara Basti (oil) in male at the age of one year it should be 1/6 Tolaa and should be increased by 1/6 Tolaa every year till 25 th year of age. The final dose at 25 th year of age should be one Prakuncha. The dose of Uttara Basti (decoction) in male one Prasrita. The dose of Uttara Basti (oil) in female one Prasrita. The dose of Uttara Basti (decoction) in female two Prasrita. The Uttara Basti should be administered continuously for 3 days followed by 3 days rest, then again should be administered for 3 days.

Heena Dosha Aphritatvta When Vaamaka drug is administered for the purpose of S`hodhana without any Poorvakarma like Svedana and Snehana it is not able to expel Dosha. The residual Utkleshita Dosha causes augmentation of disease associated with heaviness of body, Utkles`ha and Hridaya As`huddhi.

Approach to patient according to Sattva Saatvika Parkriti All above are Sattvika & desire good / healthy lifestyle. Social awareness marked. Have tendency for helping others. Emotional usually are in control. High intellect therefore a respectful & truthful approach is needed. Do not need repeated instructions. Raajasa Prakriti :- Remains angry for long time, violent, seeks weak points in opponent and strikes those, vicious, large diet, prefers non-vegetarian diet, Profound sleep and efforts, competitive and envious Controls anger, needs deep love from family members and competitiveness are the motivating factors. Doctors should not show any weakness, does not forgive easily. Therefore long past history may be needed to explore cause of illness. Large diet but not selective, excessive sex drive, unhygienic habits, hates cleanliness, insecurity feeling very strong, bullies others, eccentric and improper habits and thought processes. Approach: Fear is motivating factor, proper habits and behavior can be achieved through fear of punishment, withholding sexual activity might be greatest threat, which can be very effective. Brave when angry and afraid when calm, continuous activity harsh, agitated behavior, always under tension while harsh, agitated behavior, always under tension while eating and other activities.

Approach: Attracting attention easy but sustaining concentration difficult. Requires frequent reminders, keep extra copies of documentation as patient is likely to misplace and loose his own copies. Rewards of diet or sex may act as motivating factors. These are Rajas and Anger is the predominant emotion but physician approach will differ. Use of proper rewards and punishment (carrot and stick) gives excellent results. Tranquilizers are generally needed (use with caution in Sarpa Sattva). Taamasa Prakriti: Strongly negative attitude, secretive behavior likes to eat secretly, strong sex drive likes sleep. Approach: might be secret drinker, deep probing and observation needed for finding out behavior pattern and diet rewards more effective, particularly of sexual nature, but punishments are also effective.

Introduction Documentation of Ayurvedic clinical data in standard format is necessary today. Such data can convince the world about safety and efficacy of Ayurvedic therapies. Present Ayurveda infrastructure in India includes more than 100 research and PG centers and half million of Ayurvedic practitioners. If all these institutes or individuals document clinical data in universal format then it will help us to form evidence base for Ayurveda. AyuSoft is a comprehensive, interactive software system to assist medical practitioners and researchers in application of basic principles of Ayurveda, rational propagation of Ayurveda at global level. AyuSoft applications will help in creating this multi aspect, evidence base and integration of data from various centers and school of thoughts in a universal format. AyuSoft Applications Patient information management system: - It will help physician to document all clinical data (classical & contemporary) e.g. Lakshana, Hetu, Vyadhi, Dashavidha Parikshaa, Ashtavidha Parikshaa, Chikitsaa, contemporary etiological factors, signs & symptoms, investigations, diagnosis and treatment. Diagnostics and Treatment: - Based on Hetu and Lakshana it will provide support for probable diagnosis & treatment of the classical diseases. Prakriti Analysis: - This application is helpful in deciding Dosha Prakriti, Maanasa Prakriti and Dhaatu Saarataa of an individual. Anveshaka: - It is a data-mining tool with more than 4 lac records from classical text using permutations & combinations of more than 250 search criteria. Case Analysis: - This tool is useful for extensive for clinical data analysis with more than 200 search criteria. Multidimensional analysis of clinical data can generate many innovative findings and its correlation, those could form basis of further biomedical research. Customized Master list: - It is useful to document cotemporary etiological factors, signs & symptoms, diseases, diet & lifestyle, investigations, formulations. Encyclopedia: It consists of digitalized text, glossary, video clips of therapeutic procedure, audio files of mantra, articles, images etc. User can access all above applications through internet, intranet or desktop solution. User can import & export data, which will be useful for multi-centric trials. Data captured against a patient or a healthy individual will be useful for extensive analysis resulting in creation of evidence based Ayurveda. Using these applications, we can analyze clinical data as follows, E.g. Display :- Classical diagnosis + Dosha Avasthaa + Dhaatu Avasthaa of patients Input: - Contemporary diagnosis = AIDS Display: - Hetu of patients suffering from C.R.F. Show me patients & their classical Lakshana (Purvarupa Avasthaa) suffering from Rheumatoid Arthritis Display effect of medicine Aarogyavardhini in patients of Hepatitis Show me Dosha Prakriti, Dhatu Sarataa of patients suffering from Pandu  Show me Nadi characteristics of patients of Vataja Hridroga Show me no. of patient Input: - Classical diagnosis:-Amlapitta + contemporary Hetu :- Pizza Show me number of individuals having Kapha Prakriti in which characteristics = Mahalalaata is present. Display visit wise data and percentage of relief in patients of Lakshana Sandhi Shula treated with Abhyanga of Visha Garbha Taila. Conclusion The major achievement will be generation of evidence base through extensive and authentic documentation using AyuSoft by Ayurvedic physician, educational institutes, research institutes and hospitals all over the world. We can integrate this data to form a central scientific evaluation based knowledge repository. Based on this data we can provide scientific foundation for Ayurveda, which is the need of the day.

Immunity (Vyaadhikshamatva) is categorized into congenital, seasonal, and therapeutic. Therapeutic immunity is further divided into diet-based, exercise-based, and Rasaayana-based.\n\nRasaayana, a rejuvenating therapy, is considered crucial for strengthening immunity.

The dimensions of diseases are increasing with increasing modernization. Hence, health care industry is the most flourishing industry. Though globalization has limited the extensive nature of devastation by the growth of the healthcare industry, some of the diseases still scare the world (economy). The State and modern science is spending multi-billion dollars per to control AIDS by treatment and research program, with minimum or insignificant success. This expenditure is increasing exponentially but management of AIDS is still obscure. Even the conventional medical scientist, accept the fact that there is a lot more to explore further in the case of AIDS. AIDS therefore, is a challenge for health preservation, and poses a threat to the nation. The young generation, the backbone of the nation is ailing, and is the worst hit. In general it affects the economy but hygiene, education and growth of a country. AIDS, the acquired immune deficiency syndrome, was noticed for the first time in the United States in 1981. It is caused by the human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA virus. HIV is classified mainly into two types viz. HIV 1(A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, O) and HIV 2 (A, B). Among the various traits of HIV the HIV 1 C is widely present in India. Approximately 5.1 million are suffering from HIV / AIDS in India. Ayurveda, the science of life, a complete healthcare and treatment system originated in 300 B.C. envisaged various symptoms categorically which otherwise appear during manifestation of HIV/AIDS. Since ages Ayurveda Physicians are successfully treating the symptoms originating as the symptoms of HIV/AIDS. Fever (Jvara), Weight loss (Dhaatu Kshaya), Diarrhea (Atisaara), Wasting (Maamsa Kshaya), Herpes Zostar (Visarpa/Kakshaa), and persistent generalized Lymphadenopathy (Lasikaa Granthi S`hotha), Oral Candiasis (Mukha Paaka), Aphthous Ulcer (Mukhagata Vran`a), Bells Palsy (Ardita), and Tubercular Ascietis (Jalodara) are in the list. Several Ayurveda Physicians categorize the group of above symptoms (AIDS) as Oja Kshaya, Dhaatu Kshaya, Dhaatugata Jvara, Pratiloma Kshaya, S`hosha and Sampras`hosha. All the above-mentioned symptoms selectively appear in Dhaatugata Jvara. Hence according to the author Although HIV/AIDS is a new disease not described by that name, in Ayurvedic texts, a striking similarity is observed in the clinical picture of HIV/AIDS and Dhaatugata Jvara as described in the Charaka Samhitaa. Ayurveda propagates immunodeficiency as the cause of the above disease. Immunity is defined as the phenomenon that prevents the manifestation of disease and provides strength to fight the disease. Chakrapaan`i classifies immunity (Vyaadhikshamatva) into Sahaja (Congenital), Kaalaja (Seasonal) and Yuktikrita (Therapeutic). Yuktikrita is further classified into Aahaara (Immunity due to Diet therapy), Chesht`aa (Immunity due to daily exercise) and Yogajam (Immunity due to Rasaayana). Rasaayana is considered as the prime therapy for achieving immunity. The substance, which destroys or (eradicates) disease (s) of old age, is known as Rasaayana. According to Ayurveda Rasaayana re-establishes youth, strength, life and brain power and is capable of removing disease (s). The Rasaayana therapy is further classified in Dravya (Medicinal) and Adravya Non-material- behavioral i.e. Aachaara Rasaayana (code of conduct). Counseling is one major component in management of HIV/AIDS that critically follows the guidelines of Aachaara Rasaayana. Concentrating on Aachaara Rasaayana the therapeutic target depends on the following factors: Out of the above facts tissue-building facilitating method (Santarpan`a Chikitsaa) successfully restores the deficient immune system and prevents the associated opportunistic infections/symptoms. There are further possibilities for compliance with the 1 st criteria that need further scientific explorations with Phytomolecules. * Author suggests S`hodhana therapy to only those who are asymptomatic. Even with due indication, one should not advise S`hodhana Chikitsaa. The author also specifies that one must adopt only Santarpan`a Chikitsaa along with Aachaara Rasaayana for treatment of HIV/AIDS. Santarpan`a Chikitsaa: Balaa, as Ashvagandhaa, Aamalakee, Gud`oochi, Jat`aamamsee, Brahmee, S`hankhapushpi, Nimba, S`hataavaree, Bhoomyaamalakee, Musali, Tulsi, Rasona etc. These herbs can be used singly or in combination Author also specifies following regimen with respect to location of symptoms (Srotas): ref.

Introduction: Computer Related Injuries are the group of health problems contributed to or caused by computer usage. This disorder involves muscle, fascia, tendon and neurovascular structures, which typically afflict the neck and upper limb, eyes, back albeit any part of the body may be afflicted. They are also termed as repetitive strain injury (RSI), cumulative trauma disorder; work related upper limb disorder and occupational overuse disorder. It is estimated that 20-25 percent of all computer users worldwide are suffering from CRI discomfort. In context to India the preliminary results of an study among over 1,200 IT professionals in Bangalore (2001-2003) over 75 percent of those reported CRI symptoms of varying severity (Ref: Study by Dr. Deepak Sharan) 500 software professional at Hyderabad in 2000 revealed that over 50% had symptoms of established CRI work force affected by CRI in India includes the IT sector, Call center staff, Biotechnologists, Research scientist, Bank professionals, Receptionists, Newspaper reporters etc. The common symptoms Back pain Neck pain Shoulder pain Finger pain Arm pain Tingling, Numbness, Weakness of hand, wrist, fingers, forearm, elbow Visual strain Swelling / pedal edema The most common forms of musculoskeletal affliction caused by CRI are Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: This is caused by constant rubbing a hard surface of carpel tunnel, which leads to irritation and compression of the Median nerve. Overuse injury, particularly to the finger that clicks the mouse buttons is also common. Symptoms are constant pain in the wrist, swelling, weakness numbness, pins and needles, restricted mobility of the wrist joint. Tendon Injuries Tendinitis: Inflammation of tendons of forearm and wrist muscles caused due to repeated tensing. Fibers of the tendon start separating further breaking and leaving behind debris which induces more friction, more swelling, and more pain. Tenosynovitis: This is the inflammation of the tendon sheath. But in this case the repetitive activity are mild and not enough to cause acute inflammation but the ability of tendon sheath to lubricate the tendon is lost because of which the tendon sheath thickens, gets inflamed. Symptoms are pain in fingers with movement, also felt over the top of the hands and knuckles, burning sensation in the forearm. Eye Strain: Focusing of eyes at the same distance point for extended periods of time, less blinking of eyes, air condition or hot atmosphere, causes strain on eye muscles and they are forced to work harder. Symptoms are drying of conjunctiva, blurred vision, temporary inability to focus on faraway objects, headache, fatigue, sometimes-watery eyes. Hetu (Etiological factors): The various causative factors are Vaata aggravating factors, which induce Doshika imbalance at the complete physical level as well as at the particular body parts like spine, wrist, arm eyes etc. CRI is a complex group of symptoms afflicting one or more body parts at one time. The basic etiopathogenesis is uniform irrespective to whichever body part is involved. Vishama S`hareera Sthiti (bad posture) and Atiyoga of Karmendriya Wrong body positions and typing technique, which place unnecessary, stress Sitting down for extended periods of time Forcing to round out your lower back and hunch your shoulders, which leads to loss of S, Curvature of Lower back Lack of appropriate breaks (sedentary position) Resting the arm or wrist on a hard surface Keyboard or mouse placed too high Improper leg positioning The commonest predisposing ergonomic factors were lack of appropriate breaks (86 %), improper monitor height (60 %); keeping the mouse at a higher than recommended height (54 %); resting the arm or wrist on a hard surface while typing (42 %); and keeping the keyboard too high (40 %)(study conducted in Chennai) All the above factors aggravate Vaata Dosha, Kapha Kshaya in particular body parts. Atiyoga of Dnyaanendriya  Overstrain to eyes (Pratatekshan`a) Focusing eyes at the same distance point for extended periods of time Improper monitor height Lack of eye blinking Excess illuminated screen Dry environment, such as a heated or air conditioned office. Environment of workplaces / workstations Dry environment air  conditioned office  The S`heeta, Rooksha Gun`a of this working atmosphere leads to more stiffness in muscles, headache, pain. Other associated factors Night shifts (Call centers) Raatrau Jaagaran`a leads to aggravation of Vaata and Pitta Dosha. Habits like smoking, tobacco chewing Vaata & Pitta aggravation, Oja Kshaya Suppression of natural urges Vaata aggravation, Digestive disturbances Creates further Dosha imbalance Mental Stress Targeted jobs, skilled work requires extra concentration and mental strain, excess talking, excess Chintaa causes Rasadhaatu Kshaya, Oja Kshaya. Sampraapti (Etiopathogenesis): Vishama S`hareera Sthiti and Atiyoga of Indriya exerts overuse strain on certain Snaayu, Asthi, Sandhi, Pes`hee, Siraa, Kan`d`araa which leads to Vaata aggravation and diminution in the normal S`hleshaka Kapha. Dosha Praan`avaayu: Involvement of Indriya (Karmendriya, Dnyaanendriya) Udaana Vaayu: Bala Kshaya (Weakness in the muscles, joints initiation of action and nerve conduction) Vyaana Vaayu: Affliction of Snaayu, Kan`d`araa, Asthi, Sandhi of Gaatra involved leading to pain, weakness, stiffness, Chimachimaayana (tingling sensation), loss of sensation Tarpaka Kapha: Dryness of Eye S`hleshaka Kapha: Sandhi S`hoola, dryness, inflammation of joint structures Asthi Snaayu, Pes`hee, Kan`d`araa. Dooshya: Maamsa: Muscle pain and spasm (Snaayu & Pes`hee) Meda: Siraa (Mridu Paaka of Meda)- S`haithilya Kan`d`araa (Khara Paaka of Meda)- Sankocha Asthi: Aas`hraya  Aas`hrayi relation with Vaata Dosha Majjaa: Involvement of nerves, primarily due to compression, obstruction of normal functioning of Vyaana Vaayu. How they are wrongly treated? 65% of all cases are misdiagnosed as Spondylolysis, Arthritis, Slip disc, Tennis elbow or Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, remaining diagnosed is treated by painkillers, Steroids (cortisone) vitamin B 12 injections or Antidepressants. Most of the MRI done is found normal. No importance to prevention The right treatment is Ergonomics for prevention Regular breaks Strengthening exercise Yogika postures Ayurvedic therapies: A holistic approach can only treat CRI properly. Good Posture Back: Back should be in a slight S-shape Adjustable seat with good back support Frequent breaks and change in position. Eyes: Your eyes should point slightly downwards to the middle of your computer screen. Glare free monitor at right reading distance. Monitor should be just below the eyelevel and tilted up a little Monitor should be at an angle of 15 to 20 degrees to the eyes. Frequent breaks are a must. Feet: Your feet should rest on the floor to support your legs. The knees should be flexed at 90 degrees angle. Change your body position regularly. Wrist and Fore Arm: Wrist should not rest on any hard surface while typing. Forearm should be horizontal and resting on chair support. Elbows should be close to the body. The Right approach to treat C.R.I: Relieve the spasm in the muscles Enhance the blood circulation to provide quality nutrients and drain toxins, irritants at nerve endings Destroy the root cause of stiffness, swelling, and inflammation Provide lubrication to joints tendons, muscles Give nourishment to the muscles joints, tendons, bones Improve flexibility of muscles and joints. This can be best achieved by Baahya Snehana (Massage), Naad`ee Svedana, Patra Pot`t`alee, Jambira Pot`t`alee, Shasht`ika Pin`d`a Svedana (in degenerative cases and were nourishments is required). Basti is very useful; to treat the root cause of CRI i.e. Vaata aggravation.

One approach uses modern technology to develop convenient dosage forms that align with Ayurvedic principles. The other approach utilizes traditional knowledge as a guide to identify potent biomolecules.\n\nAyurveda considers the human body as a microcosm of the universe, composed of five elements: earth, water, fire, air, and space. The proportions of these elements determine the properties of the body. Health is maintained when these elements are in balance, and illness occurs when this balance is disrupted.\n\nAyurvedic drug design aims to restore this balance by using natural products that increase depleted elements, decrease excessive ones, and maintain equilibrium.

Darshana Shankar. Abstract:  Drug design in Ayurveda is viewed in this article in two perspectives: one is based on Ayurvedic theory, wherein modern technology I used to develop convenient dosage forms which are consistent with Ayurvedic pharmaceutical principles. The other perspective is one, which merely uses traditional knowledge as a lead to identify potent bio-molecules. The latter approach does not result in the development of authentic traditional-knowledge products Keywords: Tridosha, internal environment, homeostasis Introduction: Appreciation of the intrinsic values of a natural substance in its original or natural form with all its molecular complexities, is the corner stone of Ayurvedic pharmacy (Bhaishajya Kalpanaa) This is because Ayurvedic science has a sophisticated method (Dravya-Gun`a S`haastra) to evaluate the bio-activity of natural products in their pristine` state and does not need to isolate their chemical constituents in order to understand their biological activity. Ayurveda considers living being (microcosm) as a replica of the larger universe outside  the macrocosm. The physician is seen to be like a conveyer-belt between the two, where he/she selects such natural substances from the outer universe and makes only such changes in it, so that the body can assimilate them properly. Just as modern science views objects in terms of their atomic structure, Ayurveda views all objects in terms of their Paanchamahaabhautic configuration. The Paanchabhautika body is a body made out of five states of matter viz. Prithivi (solid), Aapa (liquid), Tejas Thermogenic (plasma), Vaayu (propulsive) and Aakaas`ha (provider room to all), in a certain proportion. The relative proportions of these five contributors determine the properties of every body. Every object has a unique configuration, which is inherent and within this natural configuration it achieves its own equilibrium. Assimilation of natural products from outside can help a body to maintain, disturb or restore its equilibrium. To understand an unhealthy situation in the body, which manifests as certain symptoms, knowledge of the Panchamahaabhoota physiology of the body is essential. Ill health is essentially due to the change in the inherent proportions of the Panchamahaabhoota_s in a body due to external or internal factor. In the context of living systems the five contributors outlined above are also expressed in terms of three physiological functions viz. Vaata (to move the principle of movement), Pitta  (to Metabolise or transform, the principle of all bio-chemical changes in the body) and Kapha (S`hlisha  Aalingane) to keep together, to adhere, to build) and these are collectively known as the Tridosha_s. The challenge of the physician is how to restore the Panchamahaabhautic or Tridoshic balance of an unhealthy body. The Tridosha_s are the three basic pillars on which the physiology of Ayurveda is constructed. Ayurvedic concept of Drug-design: The drug development in Ayurveda uses the following three principles: Ksheen`aah Vardhayitavyaah  increase the depleted (in relation to the natural configuration) in the body. Vriddhaah Kshapayitavyaah  decrease, that are increased in quantity or quality, and Samaah Paalayitavyaah  maintain the equilibrium Any disease whether acute, chronic, degenerative, infectious or functional to occur in the body has to be preceded by one of the two conditions of Ksheen`a or Vriddha of the Tridosha_s or Panchamahaabhoota_s, in the body. The teaching of the French scientist, Dr. Claude Bernard, the father of experimental physiology, can help to appreciate Ayurvedic physiology Dr. Bernard coin the word homoeostasis (internal environment). For the first time in the history of modern medicine cocks postulation of organism based disease or origin was challenged by this hypothesis. Dr. Claude proved that unless the bodys internal environment changes to a level where the equilibrium of the body is lost, no diseases can anchor in the body. This probably was the first postulation from modern science similar to the role of Tridosha_s in the genesis of diseases. The drug design in Ayurveda is thus based on a diagnosis of the extent of internal dis-equilibrium and the selection of natural products needs to be such that they can restore the equilibrium. Upas`haya is the word used in Ayurvedic paradigm to explain the favourable effect of remedial measures. These include; Aushadha  the medicines, Anna  the food that is conducive for the treatment, Vihaara  the life style changes that are part of the treatment. (Aushadhaanna-Vihaaraan`aam Upayogah Sukhaavahah). As per Ayurveda a drug does not act in isolation, but is an important part of the total regimen, which includes diet and lifestyle changes. There are also other ecological factors to be considered. Charaka categorically says, `those who treat merely with formulation and not aware of the implication of Des`ha (the habitat in which, the patient lives), Kaala (the time of disease manifestation), Prakriti (Physiosomatic constitution), etc. of the particular person, will be committing mistakes in treatment. Drug development in Ayurveda has to be done keeping this background in mind. It is also important to know that the Ayurvedic science does not limit a physician from developing new dosage forms, new delivery methods and bio-activation of raw drugs in a better way than traditionally available to us. Charaka and all other Achaarya_s have pointed out that the formulations given by them in texts are only illustrative and are applicable for limited conditions. The formulations can be blindly followed only by those, who are incapable of understanding the principles of Ayurvedic drug design, (Alpa Buddhinaam Upayogaartham) but the intelligent physician should take these formulations, as examples only, and should go beyond these worked out solutions; to design newer formulations for addressing emerging health conditions. Buddhimataam Udaaharan`a Maatram, and Idam Alam Anuktaartha Dnyaanaaya Dnyaanavataanaam). Principles of Ayurvedic Drug development. One can adopt different strategies to design an Ayurvedic drug. Drug design as per Ayurveda treatment principles address problems at three levels: To break the chain of pathogenesis To suppress disease condition To block progress To reduce complications or associated diseases To use drugs having opposite properties to that of diseases To enhance bio-availability, spread and penetration To choose dosage forms suitable to enhance absorption To suggest time of intake of the drugs to enhance its action To suit Prakriti of the person To suit local habitat and climate in which the patient resides As per Ayurveda, a drug should have the following four qualities: Bahukalpam: the ideal medicine is that which can be made into different dosage forms like powder, tablets, decoction, wines etc. Bahugun`am: it should have multiple actions like while improving the peristaltic movement it also helps in digestion Sampannam: the medicine should retain all its natural properties intact even after processing and for the duration of its shelf life. Yogyam: is the appropriateness of a medicine in a given condition, for example even if a medicine chosen is very potent in its quality and actions, but is not administered for the right condition, then it is not Yogyam in that situation. Some universal applications: There are also certain medicines, which are specific for certain diseases, and can be used in the disease irrespective of the Prakriti, Des`ha and Kaala etc. of the person. These medicines are known as Vyaadhi Vipareeta. For example in diarrhea, Paat`haa (Cessamplus Parera) which is Stambhana (anti-peristaltic), Acacia Katachu (Khadiram) in skin diseases, or turmeric in diabetics. These medicines act universally against the said diseases irrespective of the Dosha and other characters. The Modern approach: Drug development based on natural products is a fast growing area, due to the limitations of discovering newer synthetic molecules. In the conventional system drug development is based on the Pharmaco-kinetics and dynamics. A drug according to this definition is a biologically active molecule, which can act or react with a biological unit in the body to bring in a well-defined result within the given time. So drug in western medicine is like a bullet aimed at a given target, which will hit the target even while it may have other side effects. In other words, it can be said that drug by this definition is drug without a holistic intelligence. The holistic Nature of Ayurvedic Medicine: In Ayurveda a drug is that entity, which will bring in lost equilibrium of the Panchamahaabhoota_s (physiological functions) in the body and in the process correct the damages, brought by the disease. Here the drug acts with holistic intelligence. For example, when Triphalaa is taken as a purgative, it removes the unwanted materials from the system but does not; in any way disturb the intestinal flora in the process. Also when Triphalaa is taken in the appropriate dose while improving the bowel movement, it also helps to improve eyesight, increase immunity and has an anti-ageing property. Ayurveda: A New Discovery Engine Combining the strengths of the knowledge base of traditional systems such as Ayurveda with the dramatic power of combinatorial sciences and high thorough-input screening will help in the generation of structure-activity libraries. Ayurvedic knowledge and experiential database can provide new functional leads to reduce time, money and toxicity-the three main hurdles in the drug development. These records are particularly valuable since effectively these medicines have been tested for thousands of years on people. Efforts are underway to establish Pharmaco-epidemiological evidence-base to Ayurvedic medicines, safety and practice. Development of standardized herbal formulations is underway as an initiative of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) New Millennium Indian Technology Leadership Initiative (NMITLI). Randomised controlled clinical trials for Rheumatoid and Osteo-arthritis. Hepatoprotective, Hypolipedemic agents, Asthma, Parkinson`s disease, and many other disorders have reasonably established clinical effects. A review of some exemplary evidence-based researches and approaches has now resulted in wider acceptance of Ayurvedic medicines. Thus the Ayurvedic knowledge database allows drug researchers to start from a well-tested and safe botanical material. With Ayurveda, the normal drug discovery course of `Laboratory to Clinics` actually becomes from `Clinics to Laboratories`  a true Reverse Pharmacology Approach. In this process Safety remains the most important starting point and efficacy becomes a matter of validation. Globally, there is a positive trend towards holistic health, integrative sciences, system biology approaches in drug discovery and therapeutics that has remained one of the unique features of Ayurveda. A golden triangle consisting of Ayurveda-modern medicine  Science will converge to form a real discovery engine that can result in newer, safer, cheaper and effective therapies. It will be in the interest of pharmaceutical companies, researchers and ultimately the global community to respect traditions and build on their knowledge and experiential wisdom. The vast resources in Ayurveda: Nearly 5,800 clinical signs and symptoms are available in Ayurvedic texts. Effects of season, time and environmental condition as per Ayurvedic chrono-biology principles need to be considered to advise lifestyle modifications followed by dietary advice. More than 1700 species of plants, nearly100 minerals and over 100 animal products comprise the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia. Thousands of single, multiple combinations and processed formulations are described in Ayurvedic literature along-with details of drug actions. The extent of this database is very large and it can be best managed with help of suitable computer and software. Drug Discovery: Intentional Not Coincidental: In the sequence of their appearance, the scientific disciplines involved in drug discovery were: chemistry, pharmacology, physiology, microbiology, biochemistry and molecular biology. It can be shown that new therapeutic classes of drugs like muscle relaxants; diuretics, L-Dopa, antibiotics, recombinant proteins, monoclonal antibodies and others were generated on the basis of scientific opportunities rather than therapeutic need. All of these drugs were created within the confines of a chemical paradigm of medicine and drug therapy. We are now witnessing the entry of a new informational paradigm into medicine that is most prominently represented by genomic sciences, This paradigm will bring two important changes to the therapy of diseases, First, molecular biology has matured to such a degree that it can now study complex genomes and their functionality in complex organisms such as humans. Therefore, results from these studies no longer have to be translated into the context of medicine: they are already within this context, Secondly, drug therapy that used to be largely symptomatic, will now aim at targets, which are closer to the causes of diseases than previously. Therapeutic progress, which used to be indirect, conjectural and coincidental, is about to become more directed, definitive and intentional. The future drug discovery will be more often based on intent rather than coincidence. Proper bio prospecting of medicinal sources will be an important factor. Conclusion / Recommendation: To conclude it can be said that in the new era of drug development, based on natural products, there can be two paths: Once the traditional (western) methods of drug discovery based on active principles and hit the trial method and the other is intentional based on a sound understanding of the paradigm of natural products action in the body based on Ayurvedic principles. The latter one has got greater chances of success and also has lesser time bar for development as it is based on the clinical activity. Even here the health care product has to be divided into the following categories: Cosmoceutical, as against cosmetics: the product, which brings in permanent physiological changes in the body, for example  Kumkumaadi Tailam for skin fairness. This can be of Over the Counter (OTC) type. Neutraceuticals Functional foods Promotive medicines  like in the areas of; Free radical scavenging Anti-ageing Immuno enhancing Adaptogens In the areas of structural diseases like chronic kidney diseases, and Diabetic Retinopathy, etc, a package of management has to be developed where the drug will be an important component. Ayurveda says that the knowledge of whole cannot be accrued from the knowledge of the part. This means that we have to take the medicine as whole and the person also as a whole. Charaka, categorically disapproves treatment of the part. Ayurveda says there are two kinds of treatments: one is S`huddha, (pure) and the other one As`huddha (impure). The pure treatment is that, which while alleviating the disease will not become cause for any other disease. Impure treatment is that, which while curing the disease may become causative factor for other diseases. This perfectionist approach of Ayurveda has to be highly appreciated. Ayurveda strongly believes that a medicine given to the body should be fully assimilable to become part of the bodily elements. Anything that cannot fit into the definition is not regarded as a medicine in Ayurveda. The science of drug development in Ayurveda has to be seen from this broader framework so that a functionally superior health care product, based on natural substances can be developed. This reminds one of the enlightened words of the late Prof. Dhyani of Gujarat Ayurvedic University, Jamnagar. He always says, Take the medicine as a whole and treat the person as a whole. The potential of traditional knowledge in contributing to the development of the healthcare products of contemporary value, is a promising area and has to be explored by well-informed Ayurvedic scientists, if new products of any value have to be developed. The issue here is one of direction, not one of scientific capacity. Ayurveda and all other traditional knowledge systems are not in the mainstream science, not because they lack internal strength or rigor, but because of their politicosocial marginalization. Indian scientists of western and indigenous sciences need to join hands and usher in a new era of creativity that draws inspiration from our rich medical heritage Acknowledgements: We acknowledge thankfully the suggestions given by Dr. S.

Potentials of TM were recognized as probable solutions of many problems, source of Intellectual property Rights (IPR) generation and new research paradigms. Information Technology (IT) obviously started contributing in this situation for data management, communication and research activities. Emerging developments in IT reflected in new opportunities for Ayurveda, which is an ancient but complete science of life. Ayurveda is rapidly becoming center of attraction for researchers. Life style diseases like cancer, diabetes, heart disease, mental disorders are growing worldwide. Ayurveda has been looked for solutions and that is changing attitude of patients hence style of practice. Ayurveda has maintained a boost globally. That affected mindset of fresh graduates who are turning to Ayurvedic practice effectively than before and Ayurvedic super-specialization is a reality today. The resurgence of interest in Ayurveda and other Indian Systems of Medicine worldwide and the opportunities created by such interest have been well perceived by the Government and it declared first ISM&H policy in 2002. That assured more budget, infrastructure, regulation and production of able practitioner, teachers and researchers of Ayurveda  . Indian IT potential is well appreciated by the world. Content, structure and logic of Ayurvedic texts remained challenge for IT professional as well as computer savvy Ayurveda experts. Many programs for Prakriti evaluation, databases on medicinal plants and formulations, clinic management systems, authentic websites and compilation and classification of basic texts were developed in last decade. Many efforts targeted Ayurvedic physician as end user. IT: Opportunity for Ayurveda IT inputs have changed world of medicine. It has modified diagnosis, treatment and telemedicine was added recently to provide better healthcare. This situation demonstrates need of integrated efforts from IT and Ayurveda for effective Ayurvedic practice. Developments in IT would be effectively used in Ayurvedic profession for multiple objectives. It will range from training to policy making through operational research. Many IT tools can be used for global propagation of Ayurveda. Some of the areas are highlighted as example. Training Ayurveda domain has remained a challenge for teachers and experts due to its complexity and vast logic just mentioned in Samhitaa. Information retrieval was an art and lot of experience, judgment and reciting was needed. Now computers are changing this scenario by development of easy accessible data from Samhitaa. Various teaching modules could be developed in suitable multimedia form would make many complex concepts and terminologies clear. That will result in better understanding and perfection of any scholar, lay man or physician. Thus IT can play key role in preservation, exploration and presentation of ancient knowledge with enhanced access. Thus IT can help for training of Ayurvedic professionals also lay man. Effective Clinical Management Ayurvedic practice is experiencing a boom and needs to cope up with increasing expectations. Accuracy in clinical examination, better documentation, time saving clinical management etc. are few of these expectations. Networking of many physicians is a practical need for follow-up, referral and second opinion. This can be achieved by use of effective communication technology. Decision Support Systems based on Samhitaa would assist physician for more precise diagnosis and treatment. Such programs would provide ready guidance for practice. IT and generation of evidence base for Ayurveda Ayurveda is being practiced for centuries and by generations of physicians. Ayurveda is a living tradition first transferred from a disciple to researcher. Strength of Ayurveda lies in its precise diagnosis by extensive clinical examination followed by multi-target treatment regime that includes diet, lifestyle and psychotherapy. Strengths of Ayurveda are being recognized by scientific community. Preventive measures (Svasthavritta), Rasaayana concept, Panchakarma therapies, Rasaushadhi are some of the well known strengths. In spite of this heritage Ayurveda is not being projected properly on global platform. On the contrary, Ayurvedic drugs are being declared as unsafe and toxic; such propaganda needs to be addressed with proper documentation  . Lack of proper documentation, poor awareness for research, inadequate training are the most prevalent causes for this situation. According to Govt. of India data more than four lacks of Ayurvedic physicians, more than two hundred institutes and more than 50 research units are registered. Present research output does not correspond to this number. IT based Ayurvedic practice would prove a solution by converting clinical records in to an evidence and source of innovation. Clinical research, which is strength of Ayurveda, can go hand in hand with practice of thousands of physicians. Ayurvedic practice with research base, effective documentation, data generation and export can be achieved by IT inputs to practice. Propagation of Ayurveda Ayurveda aims at prevention of diseases and restoration of normal health. Concepts of Svasthavritta like Prakriti, Dhaatusaarataa etc based advice, should be propagated. IT related applications could play important role for this purpose. IT could be a vehicle to propagate Ayurvedic concepts and achieve total health.

The disease state is examined later. The word Prakriti (constitution) not only gives perception of the anatomical features but also provides an insight into the deeper internal mechanism of an individual in terms of physiology, psychology and quality and excellence of tissues.\n\nPrakriti is the Ayurvedic profile or unique psychosomatic temperament of an individual, encompassing his or her physical, functional and behavioral characteristics. The varying proportions of Kapha, Pitta or Vaata Dosha determine the S`haareera Prakriti or the Dosha Prakriti i.e., the body type which play a pivotal role. While all individuals have mixed sum of the three Gun`a, the predominant Gun`a determines an individuals Maanasa Prakriti.\n\nEvaluation of Maanasa Prakriti, i.e., psycho-spiritual profile is made by identifying the predominance of Psychic factors i.e., Sattva, Raja and Tama.\n\nDhaatu are termed as body constituents. These are seven in number and their qualitative assessment can be performed by Saarataa Pareekshan`a. Saara is the essence of that particular constituent. It reflects on various body parts in positive manner by which it is assessed.\n\nLike genetic coding, every individual has a different combination and is therefore a distinct entity in itself. That is the reason why two people react differently when exposed to a similar situation. Thus according to Aayurveda everyone is unique and each one of them has a distinct body constitution, which is completely different from each other. Nature of emotions, thought, and behavior patterns are unique to a person and are exhibited in a wide range of social and personal environment.

Aayurveda is not only limited to body or physical symptoms but also gives a comprehensive knowledge about spiritual, mental and social health. Knowing your constitution thus allows you to appreciate the workings of your mind and body better, there by allowing in managing and systematizing over the traits through planned and adequate changes incorporated into your lifestyle. Ayurveda places importance on examining the Prakriti or the natural state of an individual first, the disease state is examined later. While the medicine experts analyze the disease, the Ayurvedic expert is interested in analyzing not only the disease but the individual who is suffering from the disease. The word Prakriti (constitution) not only gives perception of the anatomical features but also provides an insight into the deeper internal mechanism of an individual in terms of physiology, psychology and quality and excellence of tissues. Prakriti is the Ayurvedic profile or unique psychosomatic temperament of an individual, encompassing his or her physical, functional and behavioral characteristics. The varying proportions of Kapha, Pitta or Vaata Dosha determine the S`haareera Prakriti or the Dosha Prakriti i.e., the body type which play a pivotal role. While all individuals have mixed sum of the three Gun`a, the predominant Gun`a determines an individual's Maanasa Prakriti. Evaluation of Maanasa Prakriti, i.e., psycho-spiritual profile is made by identifying the predominance of Psychic factors i.e., Sattva, Raja and Tama. Dhaatu are termed as body constituents. These are seven in number and their qualitative assessment can be performed by Saarataa Pareekshan`a. Saara is the essence of that particular constituent. It reflects on various body parts in positive manner by which it is assessed. Like genetic coding, every individual has a different combination and is therefore a distinct entity in itself. That is the reason why two people react differently when exposed to a similar situation. Thus according to Aayurveda everyone is unique and each one of them has a distinct body constitution, which is completely different from each other. Nature of emotions, thought, and behavior patterns are unique to a person and are exhibited in a wide range of social and personal environment. Interpretation of the same is necessary for their behavior in cultural, social and home environment. Need for understanding the concept of Prakriti: By knowing our constitution it is possible to locate our drawbacks and live at peace with nature's wishes. There are some simple rules that help in the long run. The Dosha that predominate due to our genetic inheritance dictates certain demands in terms of diet, life style and environment. If we recognize this and try to follow it, we will be able to achieve health. These are the following important reasons why knowing your Prakriti is the first step toward perfect health:- By understanding Prakriti and their specific strengths and weaknesses, you can begin to take preventive steps long before overt illness appears. Prakriti makes prevention more precise. If you try to prevent every disease without knowing your particular predisposition, its like aiming in the dark. Prakriti makes treatment more accurate once a disease appears. Study of Prakriti offers reference points for managing treatment decisions specific to each case.

This is because active research indicates addition of new dimensions of applications, which in turn is a marker of liveliness, vibrancy and futuristic approach of the branch. Research in health sector is of the utmost importance pertaining to the immediate application of the outcome to relieve human beings from pain and agony. Amongst all the branches of science, medicine is the branch, which always receives high priority due to its potential to address and solve current health problems and issues. In the course of development, about the understanding of human body and diseases over the last thousands of years, much water has flown under the bridge but the concept of gold standard remain unchanged. This is evident in a quote in Charaka Samhitaa that says the science that is practiced by the famous, successful, eminent people, praised by the intellectual class and is economically rewarding to the practitioner is the best one. The quote is just an example pointing towards the high status of Ayurveda in ancient times, which is generally achieved only when research is an integral part of the science. Available literary sources of Ayurveda not only highlight the research attitude but also elaborate the methodology to the minutest details. It is important to remember that research crux is palpable in the text all the time, indirectly. The difference is today methodology of research and statistics has become a consequential separate scientific branch associated with each respective segment of knowledge. Ample literature about how to conduct research with all aspect, is available in both text and digital form. This type of generation of literature pertaining only to research methods and statistics is not evident in Ayurvedic texts. Rather whatever is found scattered in Charaka Samhitaa  the oldest document is not found with the same or more rigor in later Samhitaa_s like Sus`hruta Samhitaa and Asht`aanga Hridaya. Therefore Charaka Samhitaa is the main reference source for this article. Introduction to concept: The quest for knowledge generates out of inquisitiveness, which ultimately leads to better understanding and explanation of various phenomena. In all ancient sciences, the methods adapted to increase understanding or knowledge base, are mainly experiential, observational and inferential. In the process of development of knowledge the perspective regarding a scientific concept or criteria of classification may change based on the logical interpretations and experimental evidences. Ayurveda is no exception to the rule where the knowledge has developed according to the above-mentioned system prevalent in those areas. Thus in order to get an unbiased view of concepts of research in Ayurveda, it is a must to understand its background circumstances and situations. Ayurveda was an oral tradition, which proliferated to the written tradition later on and currently it is being digitized to keep pace with time. Technologically the propagation of knowledge has always been at par. Questions arise about the correct understanding and interpretation of the contents of the revered science with changing circumstances. The education methodology earlier was teacher centered rather than learner centered. Methods of exchange of knowledge or testing, presentation and spread of new knowledge were relevant to those days. At times subjectivity used to take center stage on the practical level but the ultimate objective has always been to search and arrive at truth. If we compare the process of development of research methods and associated activities of oriental sciences then we find a few difference. Till the seventeenth century the perspective towards development of knowledge was holistic the world over. There was no need for separation or systemization of knowledge in a different way than the existing. But then the industrial revolution changed the traditional thought process in the west; with redefining concepts and introduction of methods of systematization; which was accepted in all fields, barring or rearranging of old principles, did not break the continuity of the understanding; instead of changed principles opened up new ways and dimensions that gave human race new tools and techniques. Change in the perspective of understanding of the science of materials and basic concepts in accordance with that gave rise to certain applications more supportive to technological development leading to a favorable atmosphere for experimental research process. Acceptance and application of the new concepts like the quantum theory, relativity principle or atomic structure in pure sciences provided a foundation for the development of experimental research techniques. True experiments were thus possible in all settings. Here the difference in current and ancient science becomes starkly cognizable. Modern science started becoming more reductionist trying to put one to one co-relation as against the traditions holistic approach of addressing complexity in one go. On the other hand the majority of the scientists from the traditional sciences did not take serious cognizance of the challenge posed by new or changed fundamentals and in turn did not make use of the new knowledge to interpret or contemporarize the heritage they carried. They went in to a shell or in defensive state that has led to hazy and misguiding picture of Ayurveda for a while. Thus being much practiced Ayurveda is always painted only as an inferential old science. Now the picture is changing. Therefore to find the facts and to assess where Ayurveda does stand today, in terms of research process some of the methods, which are reflected in Ayurveda are elaborated below. If someone has a question in mind like what are the principles of research in Ayurveda then there is nothing such as principles of research of any science including Ayurveda. To find out the relationship between cause and effect is the only one principle of research common to science as a whole. Principles are of the science stream where one applies the mind to find truth or to solve a problem. Research is a science of methods employed to gain knowledge about a particular relationship based on principles related to that phenomenon. If someone aims at finding out how effective a new chemical is which when added to petrol, reduces consumption of petrol and increases mileage then this research is designed using principles of physics and chemistry. This is true about any research problem. For convenience of understanding, approach of the present article is comparison and matching of current or modern knowledge about research with the same from three main treatises  Charaka Samhitaa, Sus`hruta Samhitaa and Asht`aanga Hridaya. Definitions and elaboration: All the basic level research is defined as a process to find the truth. At the operational level the steps involved to find the truth are: Conceptualization of an idea Hypothesis development based on principles and theories supporting the hypothesis Collection of data considering appropriate variables Verification of hypothesis through experimentation and analysis of collected data Acceptance or modification or rejection of hypothesis Strengthening of the underlying principle The exercise is completed with the help of tools. Depending on different kinds of applications theories differ and so also the tools. The whole process is interwoven in the treatises of Ayurveda except for the conduction of experiments in todays sense. As mentioned earlier more explicit and aggregate elaboration about the theories is available in Charaka Samhitaa than in all the remaining treatises; with reference to contexts at various places. One has to compile without losing the reference and essence of the underlying thought. The terms that reflect the above-stated phenomena are listed below with possible co-relation to current terms [italics indicate implied meaning] Points b and c together comprise selection and exclusion criteria. Points d and e specify the study methodology based on rational considerations Kaala  Rituayan Roopa  Specific atmospheric conditions in different seasons have a role in efficacy and certain procedures related to Panchakarma as stipulated to be conducted in a specific season only. Moreover the prescription method of a medicine is expected to be stated here as it is closely associated with time of day and food intake in accordance with the type of disease Study duration Classifications: A careful analysis of Ayurveda treatises reveals that there is a comprehensive approach regarding research along with research processes discernible in different categories according to expected focus or direction of thought, within a frame of reference. The broad categories, objectives and methodology to conduct research with a particular focus are as follows: Clinical research Drug research Literary research Epidemiological Fundamental The classification is for the understanding of the predominant characteristics of each type. In practice all types intermingle with each other at various points depending upon crux of the topic. Fundamentatal research Epidemiological research Clinical research Fundamentatal research Epidemiological research Clinical research Drug research Literary research Drug research Literary research Clinical research is defined, as a prospective study to evaluate any intervention, be it preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic against a control inhuman subjects. Another definition quotes, Clinical trial is carefully and ethically designed experiment with the aim of answering some precisely framed question  Sir Austin Bradford Hill. The definition suggests that clinical research is different from practice of medicine. Practice is aimed at the well being of a patient in spite of changes in drugs, diet and therapy as needed. Research aims at finding out the exact role of intervention in a particular situation or condition and therefore is focused. Objectives To understand the therapeutic efficacy, preventive, promotive, therapeutic actions and Also adverse reactions, of the drugs in the disease which are not documented or experienced due to the enormity of manifestations of abnormal conditions. To study the reasons of relapse of disease; effect of known drugs or treatment methods in a different dose or duration to control or avoid relapse. 3. To assess the role of dietary and behavioral restriction or positive environment in cure. In other words to study all the factors responsible in treatment of and to achieve the complete cure of a disease. The subtypes of clinical research with respect to current definition can be seen according to the focus of topic: Oral drug  Treatment using single or compound formulation [S`hamana Chikitsaa  internal medication] Behavioral  Treatments for psychological disorders. This is classified under Yuktivyapaas`hraya Chikitsaa which are termed as non-drug methods  threatening, sedation, massage, stress release, counseling  to help the patient understand his problem and facilitate a solution. Therapy Panchakarma  S`hodhana  Vamana, Virechana, Basti, Nasya, Raktamokshan`a. Yogic postures to treat some orthopaedic problems and exercises in particular conditions Surgical treatments  Application of different surgical techniques in all the branches. Methodology - Though there are subtypes of clinical research; due to practical modifications in accordance with the focal issue; basic understanding of methodology or rules for all the types do not change. The important factors in methodology are drug, equipment or instrument, patients, disease condition under study and setting of the study. Specification of all these are listed as below: Karan`a  The word denotes any material, which can be a medicine, tools like enema bag, surgical instrument, medicinal leech etc, with reference to context. The quality assurance of the drug is done based on soil type, cultivation and harvesting techniques etc. or that of instrument carries utmost importance and is written in detail. The prescription method of the medicine under study is specified according to the rules of drug administration with respect to time of day and food intake. Kaaryayoni  Here it is expected that the framework of the disease condition under study should be stated clearly. The classification of disease is important. Whether it is curable or incurable that needs continuous treatment; whether new or chronic, systemic or local. The cardinal signs and symptoms under consideration should be defined precisely. Method of examination of the particular condition should be described. Aaturades`ha  A rational understanding of any human being is achieved depending on some basic parameters. Thee are Prakriti, Vikriti, Saara, Samhanan, Pramaan`a, Saatmya, Satva, Aahaars`hakti, Vyaayaamas`hakti, Vaya which help put any person in a typical set, for better judgment of the effect and to reduce the bias generated from extraneous or sometimes attribute variables. The method gives accurate results because each factor considered here has a significant role in both healthy and disease conditions. Careful selection of patients considering all factors together leads researcher more close to the true results. The outline is comparable to selection and exclusion criteria of patients according to the set classification. It is also important to decide the dose of the medicine under study for the selected patient. Bhoomides`ha: Geographical area or study location which gives an idea about the natural climatic conditions, as well as of genetic or racial make up and socio-economical status of the subject in study. Identification of co-existence of humans and drug in a given setting is important from the viewpoint of symbiotic relationship. Specific atmospheric conditions in different seasons have a role in efficacy and certain therapy procedures are conducted in a specific season only. Kaarya : Kaaryaphala and Anubandha: These are measure with respect to the topic under study. For example, burning sensation is one complication of diabetes [Prameha-Vaataja-Madhumeha]. Yas`hada Bhasma has some control over Madhumeha Sampraapti. The main tool here is Pratyaksha. The work is carried out by the researcher employing the above-mentioned parameters. Clinical research examples: The clinical research process is evident at various places in the Samhitaa_s. One or two are quoted here. Clinical research comment: A clinical research project is designed on the basis of Yukti a systematic, intelligent arrangement of thought based on Aaptopades`ha known facts about the topic; conducted Pratyaksha  in specified precise setting; with Anumaana  expected outcome or inference. When the work is complete it can be added to Aitihya a written document. There are no references to the designs like randomized controlled trials or longitudinal methods but the theme method can be co-related to case control studies which are now being supported by WHO considering individuality. Also keeping the meaning at the core intact, new thinking can be developed. Drug is the most important factor in treatment because it is the real material tool, which cures. The approach of research in medicine is drug centered all the time. Other tools of treatment like counseling get comparatively less prominence than the drug. Therefore scope of drug research is very wide. Ultimately, clinical research is a proliferation of drug research which has been studied separately for convenience or understanding. Objectives: Methodology Drug research has a wider scope as it deals with all the aspects of a drug. The method varies depending on a particular aspect under study. Therefore subtypes in drug research are pharmacognosy, pharmaceutics, pharmacology including therapeutics and toxicology. It is must to note that research in any of the above direction is conducted with medicines prepared under strict observance of quality assurance parameters. Each type is elaborated below with reference to the context. Pharmacognosy: Identification of raw material is of utmost importance and at times of crisis, help should be taken from local people who are regular users of plants, specification regarding nature or morphology of the plant which in turn depends on soil type and regional agro-climatic conditions i.e. habitat; and collection or harvesting season; are monitored for quality. The nature of a drug is tested based on the direct examination by Panchendriya Pareekshaa because the drugs are Paanchbhautika. According to test results the drugs are classified into Paarthiva, Aapya, Taijasa, Vaayaviya, and Naabhasa categories depending on the predominance of one of the five constituting Bhoota for the convenience of understanding. This hypothesis comes close to an accurate knowledge of the constitution type of drug on which judgment is built, about its processing, formulation and activity. Criteria of best quality drug: The single drug, which can be converted into many dosage forms, having high potential, multi-dimensional efficacy and easy availability is the best drug. Comment: Correct identification is an important pre-step, on which actual pharmaco-therapeutics is dependant. This fact is stressed upon in all the treatises though the drugs were forest produced and use of local talent at controversial time is a wise mans best attitude. Pharmaceutics: Pharmaceutics is the next step towards effect. This is the most interesting part, which deals with enormous possibilities of drug development. It is amazing to note that the treatises never restricted to a fixed number of formulations rather always keep open ways to new possibilities. The main objective of phamaceutics is to bring palatability to the drugs along with its better availability for targeted efficacy in the body in a small dose. Pharmaceutical quality assurance emphasizes on the method of harvesting and preservation where principles like comparative selection considering parameters like habitat, season, maturity, Vipaaka, Veerya, and Rasa are adopted. Moreover storage techniques and use of container is specified according to characteristics of individual drug items like fresh, dry, poisonous, expensive etc. the core section of pharmaceutics i.e. processing is elaborated with the help of principles of drug development with reference to the following factors The Samyoga is brought about by Samskaara. Samskaara is the key to fetch a desired change in the set of physical, chemical and biological properties of the drugs. The raw drugs are processed by various methods appropriate for each drug. These include washing using water, boiling, heating, churning, trituraton, marinating and more. Varieties of apparatus are used for the processing and the process is carried out in a particular area [pharmacy], climatic condition, for particular time period to get a good quality medicine. Quality of best formulation: A formulation has to be simple to administer, fast acting in minimal dose and without any untoward effects. It is possible to design infinite formulations using one drug or combining many potential drugs on the basis of correct understanding of complexity stated above, involved in the process. Therefore to predict or limit the exact number of formulations is difficult. Comment: This is a guideline which, may further be extended and brought into practicality by employing new technologies of manufacturing and combinatorial chemistry techniques in virtual laboratory for drug designing. Pharmacology: This section deals with the action of medicine  single drug or compound formulation. How a medicine acts; what change it brings in the status of Dosha_s; how it moves in the body or what transformation it undergoes once in the body system is studied in pharmacology. Pharmacodynamics: The thrust of analysis is upon attributes [Gun`a] and the specific function [Prabhaava]. Pharmacodynamic research is generally focused on the five factors, which are elaborated as Rasa, Gun`a, Veerya, Vipaaka, Prabhaava. If the medicine is developed from a single drug then the efficacy can be explained with the help of three features  Dravyaprabhaava. Gun`a Prabhaava or both. The dynamics of any particular formulation for primary and secondary expected action is examined with respect to some aspects namely: This is verified by actual results on the patients. If a multi-ingredient formulation is designed, applying creative thinking based on knowledge of factors like synthesis elaborated in pharmaceutics, then the final cumulative effect of the compound of the body is rationalized by applying the guidelines described to identify the Rasa-Dosha Sambandha and drug  disease relationship. The efficacy may be due to cumulative Rasa, Veerya, Vipaaka, Gun`a etc of the compound formulation or single drug. To find out the rational in each set of drug  disease is the pharmacological research pertaining to dynamics. This concept opens possibilities for development of innumerable formulations. Pharmacokinetics: The study deals with the movement of a drug in the body. Here the principles which are explained in relation to food may be applied to drugs because, drugs when administered orally follow the same route that of food. There are three types of distribution viz. selective distribution [Khale Kapota], sequential distribution [ Kedaara Kulyaa] and direct yet immediate distribution [Ksheer-Dadhi Nyaaya]. A clear statement regarding time of action of drugs mentions that activity of aphrodisiacs is seen immediately and that of all the other medicines within 24 hours. Another reference elaborates some symptoms, which are indicative of complete metabolism of medicine in the body. If the expected efficacy is not achieved within seven days duration then it is advised to discontinue the drug and after some gap, to avoid interaction, new treatment should be commenced. There is no specific record however, of an individual medicines action in a specific span with a few exceptions like Aarogyavardhini and Gandhaka Kalpa in later texts. Pharmaco-therapeutics: This branch is generally merged with pharmacology. In the context of modern medicines, the study of a new chemical entity is incomplete without knowing its action in a particular dose, frequency and administration method in a particular disease condition. But during last decade or two, studies are planned and conducted on known medicines or formulation to see other affects in various dose schedules. The famous example is of aspirin as an anti-platelet drug. A similar concept is the best proof in Ayurveda. There are fifty types of primary action. They are sub classified into therapeutic, preventive and promotive categories. In each action group there are ten individual plants capable of achieving the effect singly and in combination thus leading to 500 end products. The therapeutic studies for any drug are designed considering factors like a particular dose of the medicine, a prescription technique consisting of Anupaana, time of day, before or after meals, to treat a particular disease, in a person of particular constitution; to assess whether it eliminates the vitiated Dosha or pacifies it. To exemplify, the drug Pippali [Piper longum] possesses two primary actions; digestive [ Deepaniya] and appetizer [ Triptighna]. Another drug Haridraa [Curcuma longa] is included into anti-dermatosis [[Kusht`haghna] as well as in poison anti-dote [Vishaghna] action groups. In other words one drug does possess more than one main therapeutic action in different dosage forms, doses, different prescription schedules according to administration time and with respect to season and other factors. Based on thee principles pharmaco-therapeutic studies of various combinations can be designed. The best example of pharmaco-therapeutics is the development of potent medicines known as Bhasma, from mineral-metal sources by treating them with medicinal herbs. Rasas`haastra [Rasa is mercury] became a special branch of Ayurveda in the later era during first century AD. Therapeutic efficacy of these metallic preparations and herbo-mineral preparations added new dimensions to treatment. The therapeutics also focuses on relationship between food and drug. Efficacy of the medicine is increased if some type of food items are consumed during the course of treatment and it decreases with some other types of food. To exemplify; during the treatment of Vran`a the patient must avoid salty, sour and hot and heavy foods which negatively influence the rate of cure. Instead he should consume moderately heavy, soothing, and tasty but non-spicy food. Also he should not indulge in exertive acts or take a nap in the afternoon, which adversely influences cure. The concept of Pathya and Apathya not only is restricted to food but also is stretched to exercise and behavior patterns, which have a definite role in cure. A completed study of known drugs to treat unknown disease conditions must be undertaken considering the variables Dosha, Aushadha, Des`ha, Kaala, Baala, S`hareera, Aahaara, Saatmya, Satva, Prakriti and Vaya. This is the best guideline, which propounds the role of each and every variable in the process of cure. Comment: Thus the therapeutics in Ayurveda can be co-related to the concept of clinical pharmacology in its entirety. Various approaches can also be co-related with dose response studies, effect of presence of food in stomach during drug administration etc. Toxicity and Incompatibility / Intolerance: Along with therapeutics the concept of adverse reaction and toxicity is also explained. Adverse reactions are defined as the harmful effects occurring with does intended for therapeutic effect. Toxicity is the direct action of the drug at high dose, damaging cells. Intolerance is a low threshold to the normal pharmacological action of drug. Normally a medicine or therapy is administered to patients by taking all precautions but as the efficacy depends on many factors; misjudgment of one or two may lead to adverse reactions. These may be seen due to a substandard drug too. There are other possibilities that patients are not always knowledgeable [Dnyaapaka] and may furnish misinformation unintentionally or the treating Vaidya is in-experienced. Examples of adverse drug reactions are evident in the texts. The detailed contra-indications mentioned for Vamana, Virechana and Basti have originated from the understanding of adverse reactions of the procedures. In Ayurveda medicated wines are administered in treatment of various conditions. Medicated wines have a positive effect on all the sense organs and intellect. At the same time it develops toxicity it prescribed to those for whom it is contra-indicated or consumed in excess dose. The toxicity of Copper [Taamra] is mentioned in the very first chapter of Charaka Samhitaa as an example. In the texts of Rasas`haastra, toxicity of each and every material used as a drug source in raw or partially processed form is documented. Antidotes of each one are mentioned too. A guideline regarding therapeutics states that many medicines are intolerable to children, elderly, thin and fragile ladies in their normal therapeutic dose, which give rise to certain adverse effects. In such cases the doses are altered to suit the needs of the patient. Comment: Though these are not comparable to the toxicity studies conducted today but are more valuable as these are generalized conclusions of toxic effects on patients. They point towards retrospective inferences. Drug Research Examples: The formulation Pippali Ksheera that is Piper longum processed in milk is advised and not Pippali Kashaaya. Similarly use of Centella asiatica juice, Glycerrhiza glabra powder or Convolvulus pluricaulis paste with milk to achieve the Medhya effect [nootropic] points out that a particular dosage form along with a particular Anupaana is administered to achieve a specific pharmacological action is nothing but a conclusion after research. Another example comes from a later text like Bhaavprakaas`ha. Chopachinee [Smilex china] a plant of Chinese origin is identified for its Rasa Veerya, Vipaaka, Gun`a and Karma. Its action is best seen in powder form than decoction, in inflammatory conditions of joints and second or third stage or venereal diseases. Drug Research Comment: At this point it is a must to note that the understanding of Ayurveda with respect to drug quality assurance, toxicity, antidotes, and efficacy is similar to the current understanding. The development of dosage forms like Parpat`ee or Pot`t`ali are concrete examples of drug development process through research where herbs and minerals  metals are processed together. It is obvious from the above data that the factors, which must be considered accountable for the quality of a drug, do not end with the drug but they encompass the particular patient and the particular etiogenesis. To elaborate further; the Q factor depends on all thee variables and not on one or two. Rather, if any one of the whole set is not fulfilled then there can be a change in the expected or predicted efficacy. To emphasize the point further; it becomes crystal clear that any Ayurvedic drug cannot be labeled standard based only on its chemical reactivity pattern but has to be standardized on the specific biological or biochemical responses. This can only happen in live tissues and therefore biological models may help not only to understand the mechanism of action but also as a counterbalance to develop a marker to know whether the drug is standard or not. The guidelines to develop the profile of any unknown drug right from its identification to its therapeutic use are elaborated in the texts. Some details may be added due to technological advancement but the theme remains unchanged. The original thought of using existing drugs to treat new disease or new syndromes is clearly evident in Charaka Samhitaa. This may be the first attempt towards clinical pharmacology because the parameters are clearly laid down to initiate such use of medicine in unknown situations. Introduction: Literature is the means to transfer knowledge from generation to generation. New knowledge that is acquired is stored in literature. Literature is generated by intellectuals in the society for various purposes like entertainment, spread of information, dissemination of technical details and many more. As mankind is enriched with many races and communities region wise; literature also develops in all possible ways. Generally, till the last century literature used to originate in the mother tongue of the persons, writing it. Over the time, form, structure and style of writing has been designed based upon the thought process of the experts in the field and then a definite set of rules and conventions evolved according to the type of the information to be communicated. Development of new knowledge, in other words understanding the phenomenon of life in all respect, is a continuous process, which is expressed using language. New words are coined. Every language gets enriched with time due to the cross-cultural interactions taking place between the people. Not only goods are exchanged when two different communities come together but there is a cultural exchange as well. Meanings change through decades and centuries with reference to contexts. New concepts, ideas are propounded. Some of them always remain at the forefront while some others are recorded but ignored or forgotten. However literature maintains a continuous thread of knowledge diversities. At times it becomes essential to trace the literature to explore an unexplored possibility. It initiates knowledge based on imagination. Literary study encompasses all these factors, which strengthen the knowledge base. It is a must to note that there is difference between the standard meaning of literary research and that of Ayurvedic literary, research. In the original sense the term literature is associated with presentation of human emotion and the term literary theory is linked to artistic writing. In the context of Ayurveda literature, these terms may not be useful because Ayurvedic literature is scientific material generated through many centuries to disseminate the information regarding the science of health. It has followed the rules of writing, which existed at the time of development of the Ayurvedic literature. As Ayurveda has been practiced for more than 2500 years, there exists a considerable amount of contemporary literature generated in each century to address relevant health problems. Thus it becomes essential to focus on literary research in terms of content rather than its artistic aspects. This process is defined in the treatises as follows: Objectives: Materials and methodology: There are two processes involved in literary research; how to analyze literature critically and how to write. Materials: the main materials are literature of various types: Except for the last one, all other types of literature were available in manuscript form in those days till the innovation of printing. Method of literary research of manuscripts to prepare correct document for printing is known as manuscriptology. Since the 18 th century the material were available in printed form. The guideline in Sus`hruta Samhitaa underlines that to acquire complete knowledge about anything it is a must to read and analyze a variety of treatises and all types of literary works. It further advocates that reading together relevant scientific works along with continued study of ones own science and discussions leads to enlightenment of intellect. To analyze literature critically it has to be examined from three viewpoints: In the Ayurvedic treatises there are references regarding all the three aspects. Chronology aspect: The explanations regarding chronology, geographical areas etc. are covered in each text in the initial chapter only. Various practices regarding food habits, dressing of different races of people with their genotypic and phenotypic characters are also explained at different places with reference to context. Descriptions of people taking part in conferences are noted in apt words to enable the reader to a view of his background. These are some examples to explain the above points. Structure Aspect: Literature shows a particular type of structure when the main three treatises Charaka Samhitaa, Sus`hruta Samhitaa and Asht`aanga Hridaya are scrutinized. They are Sthaana  part, Adhyaaya  chapter, and Sootra  verse. Also each chapter is structured to fit in a pattern of introduction, elaboration and summary of a topic. All the topics are covered in a logical sequence. Predominant form is poetic with some prose at places for better explanation. In the later compendia 10 th century onwards, including Laghutrayee, the chapter pattern remains same but that of parts i.e. Khan`d`a and of other arrangement is different. This itself is an evidence of literary research. Post 18 th century the literature is written in prose form and not in poetic. Language of interpretation has also changed from Samskrita to regional ones and in recent years it has changed to English; though the principle of structural analysis is the same. How to analyze a document critically, starts from selection. The text or literature has to come from the domain of well-known, successful, eminent and intelligent scientific fraternity; then only it is considered authentic. These guidelines help to understand the structure in detail. Content Aspect: This aspect is well explained in Charaka Samhitaa. The parameter is elaborated under the umbrella term Tantrayukti which means the methodology or technique or systematic approach of studying a Tantra to interpret its correct and unambiguous meaning for its practical application. There are total 36 major and 4 minor Tantrayukti_s. The number of Tantrayukti_s differs according to Samhitaa. It depends on the authors viewpoint of expression and his judgment about confusing statements. He propounds use of those specific Tantrayukiti_s for the benefit of the readers. The difference is practically negligible and all the important treatises follow the same types of Tantrayukti_s. Adhikaran`a Tantrayukti denotes subject [Ingrammatical sense], which can be of the entire science or of its part or of a chapter or of subpart of a chapter or of a single sentence. Similarly if one gets confused to establish the co-relation with one set of Dosha as Vaayu, Pitta, Kapha and another set of Karma Basti, Vireka, Vamana, then Vidhaana Tantrayukti helps to solve the problem. Vidhaana means orderly and systematic placement. It becomes easy to understand that Basti, Vireka and Vaman procedures are employed for Vaayu, Pitta, Kapha respectively. Each Tantrayujkti plays a specific role here. The literature must comply on the parameter of Tantrayukti to receive critical acclaim. Another aspect of examining the Tantra is Vaakyas`hah, Vaakyaarthas`hah and Arthaavayavas`hah which indicates concept of Panchaavayava Vyaakya. It means that the literature is examined as a whole on comprehensive level to grasp its total content; further it is examined in detail to get the theme and principle, elaborate and concise descriptions wherever necessary, in the standard pattern of statement or hypothesis, rational of the hypothesis, supportive and appropriate general examples, establishing the hypothesis with logical explanation. One more feature is to assess whether an attempt is made to simplify the complex content to extract correct meanings for better understanding of an average reader or not. Here the method of getting the correct meaning through Lakshan`a interpretative or implied meaning is applicable. The literary meaning may give a false interpretation while implied meaning of the same words will give true interpretation because it is associated with practical experience. Apart from these two main domains under content analysis there are other parameters termed as Pramaan`a [4types] Tools Vyaakhyaa [15] operational definitions, Kalpanaa [9]  concepts, Nyaaya [17]  general rules and Taachchhilyaadi [17]  specific conventions; which are examined in the process of analysis of literature. Some of thee are related to grammar as well. The text is evaluated for presence of any of the fifteen Tantradosha. This highlights the complexity involved in methodology of literary research during development of Ayurvedic literature. B] Method of presentation of work: The method of presentation of the work, which can be of any type  literary, experimental or clinical  is discussed in literary research. It can be done in two ways, either in written form or an oral presentation. The guidelines regarding written documentation follow the same structure used for evaluation I.e. hypothesis, establishment of study hypothesis and null hypothesis, tools used, discussion including elaboration of the topic under study with appropriate yet easily understandable examples, specific conclusion, principle on which the hypothesis is based. The guidelines regarding oral presentation are also very precise. Oral presentation happens in a conference. For all practical purposed based on the objectives, conference can be either scientific or purely academic oriented or showy. Participants at both places may have three types of attitude: friendly, indifferent and obstinate. Based on these parameters validity and authenticity of the research done is acknowledge in the scientific fraternity. The presentation tactics to make own impression, to neutralize other speakers are also elaborated in the chapter. The presentation has to be within the parameters mentioned for writing a report. Apart from these, the researcher has to be well acquainted with some techniques, which are explained as Vaadamaarga. He has to satisfy all the queries raised regarding the subject or topic he presents; with properly supported justifications. In the end of this discussion the importance of literary research is emphasized by saying that clarity of thought and acquisition of knowledge by presentation of research work and open discussion is must for administration of treatments to patients because ultimately that leads a researcher to success. Literary research examples: The best example of literary research is of Charaka Samhitaa itself. Its original title was Agnives`ha Tantra after the name of its author. This text was edited by Charaka who incorporated new findings, elaborated some concepts, changed some part from the original text to suit the need of his time and the text was renamed as Charaka Samhitaa. Further the same process was carried out by Drid`habala to add new knowledge and to complete the missing. One-third part of the original Charaka Samhitaa. We refer to this text today. Apart from this, thirty-five scholars have written commentaries on the text to relate the meaning with experience of their time. Another example is of Asht`aanga Samgraha and Asht`aanga Hridaya by Vaagbhat`aachaarya. The text is prepared to place medicine and surgery together for the benefit of learners which is written with reference to Charaka Samhitaa  the bible of medicine and Sus`hruta Samhitaa  the bible of surgery. More recent texts regarding methods of clinical diagnosis Maadhavanidaanam written by Maadhavakara and the handbook of medicine Chakradatta by Chakrapaan`i are examples of contemporary literary research because unlike the original, these are topic oriented texts that represent the thought line prevalent in that century. Literary research Comment: The most important feature or gain from literary research is realization of the thought process of construction of theory or principle, which is, at times more valuable than the content itself. The guidelines reflect stringent criteria which a literary work or presentation has to comply with. Only then the scientific fraternity of the first type accepts it. This is a remarkable feature existing even today. The techniques described or factors considered for literary research seem complex in modern days because of the main constraint of limited availability of writing material, which is responsible for preparation of a few copies of manuscripts of any book. It must have been quite a worthwhile. Brainstorming exercise to express the content in a well-structured  mainly poetic  form without hampering the exact shade of meanings. Today writing, printing and publishing has become easily accessible and affordable to the common man. The extra efforts of using poetic form are reduced but the basic principle of correct usage of terminology, sentence construction, grammatical correctness and expression in minimum possible words to convey a scientific invention and discovery remains the same. This places Ayurveda on a higher pedestal as the best example of medical literature. Epidemiological research Epidemic is disease outbreak occurring suddenly in numbers clearly in excess of normal expectancy. Epidemiology in its true sense is the science concerned with the study of factors determining and influencing the frequency and distribution of disease, injury and other health related events and their causes in a defined human population for the purpose of establishing programmes to prevent and control their development and speed. Epidemiological research is no different than the meaning explained above. Currently the scope of epidemiological research is widened to the concept health statistics of population due to inclusion of studies regarding effects of various types of foods, habits like coffee, tea, smoking, alcohol etc., exercise and occupation of large population groups. These types of population studies are described as descriptive research in sociology from where various models like case control or time series have come. The concept similar to the original meaning of epidemiology is explained under the title Janapadodhvamsa in Charaka Samhitaa, infectious factor in Sus`hruta Samhitaa while other aspects are taken care of in different parts like S`haareerasthaana, Sootrasthaana etc. Objectives: Materials: Methodology: In the opening statement of the third chapter in Vimaanasthaana, Rishi Aatreya suggests that the methodology employed to conduct this type of study is direct observation [Pratyaksha] and inference [Anumaana]. Experts who are able to sense the undesired changes that take place in the normal atmospheric conditions can predict its effects on human health based on their experience. Similarly behavioral changes are noticed by psychologists and social scientists that, they can predict the social behavior of the future generations. Once the catastrophe strikes then, only relief work can take place and it should be provided to the needy and seeking is another piece of advice by Rishi Aatreya. The studies, which are conducted to fulfill the above-mentioned objectives, are designed using all four tools viz. known recorded facts [documented data], practical experience, rational thought and logical interpretation. Moreover the main tools are observation and inquiry. In case of direct observations the researcher must have a keen attitude to grasp the situation under study and he must use all the five sense organs coupled with intellect efficiency to understand the situation. Similarly the questions must be logical, relevant, simple and to the point to get the right kind of information. Epidemiological Research Examples: The best food article from a group of similar articles or the best drug which has desire effect amongst all drugs with similar effect cannot be decided unless a large population has shared the same experience or shown the same type of result. Also the most harmful fish is Chilachima or eating fish and milk together leads to skin disease are the outcome, which can be generated only after many observations, are put together. Effect of pollution on environmental factors like air, water, soil and the measures to be adopted in such conditions to maintain the health of people, is an example of epidemiological study. Epidemiological Research Comment: It seems that the present methods of epidemiological research, observation and inquiry were used with both approaches prospective and retrospective. When the suggestions like what dietary and behavioral pattern an expecting couple should practice if a typical progeny is expected are written then it is indicative of prospective one. Similarly all Pitta dominant Prakriti people suffer from blood disorders if they indulge themselves on hot taste foods, alcohol, consumption, work under burning sun for a considerably long period is a prospective kind of study. In case of guidelines of predicting death of a suffering person, or effects of Viruddha Aahaara in developing certain skin conditions; the approach is retrospective. This statement one can make because the science that propounds ethics in use of plants would not try harmful things on humans. The section of Charaka Samhitaa where these observations are recorded categorically is titled as Indriyasthaana. Dictionary meaning of the word is as follows: Fundamental: serving as a base or foundation, essential Principle  truth as basis of reasoning Theory  systematic exposition of principles of science. A theory is a set of interrelated constructs, definitions and propositions that present a systematic view of phenomena by specifying relations among variables, with the purpose of explaining and predicting the phenomena. However, conventionally principle and theory are used as synonyms of each other with reference to context. In a nutshell, the true basis of reasoning which serves as essential or as a foundation to understand a phenomenon is known as fundamental principle. Fundamental principles are few, which give rise to many systematic expositions called theory. Theory involves a consideration of the principles governing practice, and different theories will point to different kinds of practice. The natural principles behind every phenomena happening in the universe are termed as fundamental principles of natural science. The phenomenon may be normal or abnormal; principle remains unchanged in the particular case. Theories are developed considering the specific variables taking part in the particular practice. Therefore they are applicable to that setting. The research that is focused on fundamental principles or theories with an aim to find out the true reasoning behind any phenomenon is known as fundamental research. The fundamental principles are categorized into two parts  universal and pertaining to a specific area. During ancient days Hindu scientific ideas and methodology had deeply influenced natural philosophy in Asia. The construction of scientific concepts and methodology to investigate the physical phenomena as well as building up a body of positive scientific knowledge was stored under the title Dars`hana. There are nine Dars`hana_s, which are grossly co-related with the modern scientific understanding. A few examples are given below which are quoted from Pr. Brajendranath Seals book Positive Sciences of Ancient Hindus. Based on these basic sciences applied branches originated; like Astronomy, plant biology, etc. while assessing the potential of Oriental sciences; experts have also suggested that the Veda_s are basic sciences while Upaveda_s are applied ones. S`hilpas`haastra is the applied part of Rigveda, Dhanurveda is of Yajurveda, Gandharvveda is of Saamveda and Ayurveda is applied branch of Atharvaveda. Therefore Atharvaveda talks of basic biological principles, which are elaborated and modified according to the area of application. Those related to plants are developed in Vrikshaayurveda, related to elephants are Hastyaaurveda and those to horses are As`hvaayurveda. Ayurveda, which deals with the health of human beings is an applied science, which originated from basic concepts related to ancient biology. The basic principles are accepted and modified in Ayurveda within its frame of reference to understand the functions taking place in the human body. The modification of fundamental principles within the framework of Ayurveda is explained in Charaka Samhitaa The word Siddhaanta means theory or fundamental principle. Siddhaanta is defined as the ultimate true decision taken by many scientists [unanimously] after employing various tools or methods of scientific examination. Siddhaanta is classified into four groups. There are many such principles. These are common to every branch of science Chikitsaa Siddhaant Shaareera  Daiva and Yukti; Manas  Satvaavajaya Sadya vikaara Sootra  Viparitagun`a, Des`ha, Maatraa, Kaala Objectives: To find out the exact theory behind unknown disease syndromes from generated or gathered evidence To provide a rational and to design method of treatment of new and unknown health conditions based on fundamental principles To find out the exact cause  effect relationship between efficacies due to particular treatment - preventive promotive or curative  and the new unknown condition under study. Methodology : The tools that help to unfold the true knowledge regarding any effect are termed as Hetu. These parameters are of four types and known as Pramaan`a_s. Definition of Pramaan`a is Pramaa Karan`am Pramaan`am, where Pramaa means true positive knowledge. The tools or parameters, which enable one to reach unto the truth, are Pramaan`a_s. Charaka Samhitaa elaborates the types of Pramaan`a_s at three places with reference to context. Sequentially they are listed as: Aapta or S`habda or Aitihya  Authentic scientific evidence documented in literature like Veda Upanishada and moreover from the devoted scientists. Pratyaksha  Direct, validated, logically analyzed experiences of each individual. Any experience perceived by an individual using his sense organs can be analyzed as gross level experience and subtle level experience which explains the details. Also it can be classified as present experience and past experience. Anumaan`a  This tool operates based on the above two tools Aapta and Pratyaksha. Method of prediction or judgment is of two types; futuristic and inferential. Futuristic prediction is based on logical analysis of knowledge acquired through documents and past experience while inferential judgment is based on drawing conclusions from the immediate experience. Yukti  Designing and putting Aapta and Pratyaksha together in a logical way to propose answers to unknown phenomenon. This is also known as creative thinking or management of thoughts as well as events: One more parameter is explained which is termed as Upamaana. It is accepted from Nyaaya-Dars`hana to exemplify certain disease conditions. It points out similarity between two objects which may not necessarily have some common factor but only visual similarity e.g. Dan`d`a means stick. Cardinal sign of the disease Dan`d`aapataanaka is stiffness of the body similar to stick or Dhanusha means arch, hence the disease where body bends like an arch of the archer is named Dhanustambha. By employing all the tools a researcher can analyze and find out the true relationship between cause and effect. The relationship can be of two types Nitya i.e. permanent and Anitya i.e. short term. The cause can be of three types  directly responsible for the effect, associated but not solely responsible for the effect and responsible for only a particular section or at a given moment of effect [Samavaayi, Asamavaayi, Nimitta] All the three factors lead to real or true knowledge, which is of two types comprehensive or with minute details depending on the approach of the researcher. The whole exercise of research is done in the quest of true knowledge. It is done with the help of theories mainly within the limit of Pratitantra and Adhikaran`a. Change in theory coming within the ambit of Sarvatantra leads to the change in theories of the other two that depend on it. Change in the principles of basic sciences reflects change in applied sciences. Fundamental research examples The twelfth chapter in Charaka Samhitaa titled Vaatakalaakaleeya explains the functional types of Vaata Dosha but does not elaborate in types of remaining two Dosha_s. About a millennium later Asht`aaanga Hridaya elaborates Pitta Dosha and Kapha Dosha in similar fashion. The hypothesis is Pitta and Kapha can also be classified on the basis of functionality. The 63 permutations and combinations arising from six Rasa_s explained in Charaka Samhitaa are cross matched with 63 permutations and combinations originating from three Dosha_s in Asht`aanga Samgraha The debate about number of Rasa documented in Aatreya-Bhadrakapyeeya is chapter of Charaka Samhitaa, underlines that fundamental principle regarding the number of Rasa is six. It was challenged and various hypotheses like Rasa are two, three or eight were tested on above-mentioned parameters with a conclusive justification by Rishi Aatreya that Rasa_s are six. Similarly D`alhan`a at one place proposes that Rakta should be considered the fourth Dosha, which is debated by other Dosha_s are three is confirmed. Fundamental Research Comment: A careful scrutiny of all the types of research explained in the above article or known today or has been practiced since ages are merely a part of the fundamental research. Literary study is predominantly within the limit of the tool Aapta / S`habda or Aithihya; experimental or experiential methods come within the tool Pratyaksha; epidemiological studies are conducted using the parameter of Anumaana and Yukti encompasses all types of studies. When a study is conducted at a single level of literary etc, then generally it is guided by established principles unless it challenges the accepted theory. Each research problem focusing each of the area aims at finding out true relationship between cause and effect. All the tools must be put together to verify fundamental principle. Principles of Fundamental research explain the method of science. How to analyze and understand any unknown fact is elaborated in this method. Most important fact is that the principles have not changed over the last thousand of years and the change in application is also not very drastic. What has changed is development of technologies, which aid Pratyaksa and enable oneself to acquire knowledge directly, which was not possible before. Apart from the main body of method of science concept of bias is covered where criteria of Aapta, Guru S`hishya, are decided. They suggest an impartial attitude and point out that only quality should be considered. Concept of ethics is touched upon while elaborating on the rules of collection of raw drugs or gathering information from shepherds or behavioral conduct of Vaidya, with respect to patient. The marvel of the scientists of Ayurveda period is, that they have kept open all possibilities of gaining new knowledge and have not posed themselves as rigid followers. Statistics in Ayurveda Statistics is the science of collecting and analyzing significant numerical data. Numerical means to deal with numbers. But the numbers are understood in two ways mathematics as well as statistics. Mathematics gives complete stepwise sets and solution exact and unchanging, leaving no room for accepting errors while statistics keeps the possibility of change open and gives solutions in a probabilistic manner. In mathematics if the results differ from the expected; then it proves that the method is wrong; but in statistics it is not so. Statistics is based on the principle of error [or Obsolon], which deals with the allowable errors involved in experiment. These are natural errors, which are irremovable. Statistics is an applied science and is used in medical science, psychology, engineering, social sciences, economics, and education. However mathematicians and statisticians bifurcate from one common stream of numerical data. At some point it may be said that the method is inadequate and at other the thought has not missed out on anything rather has a more subtle understanding of the analyzing processes. In all the three treatises, particularly in Charaka Samhitaa, numerical values are used for a particular data. Right from the beginning of the principles there are numerical values use to denote five Mahaabhoota_s, three Dosha_s, three Upakrama_s, three Rogamaarga_s, eight Mahaagada, eight Nindita etc. in the chapter Snehaadhyaaya there is a direct evidence of presence of Saankhya people who are trained in the philosophy of Saankhya [numbers]. Wherever there is description regarding the thought process about the unknown disease, drug or treatment modality statements indicative of probability are made. The quotes saying Bhettaa Hi Bhedyam Anyathaa Binnatti, or Tasya Vikalpaat Aparisamkhyeyaani Bhavanti Vikalpabhedaat Aparisamkhyeyatva are indicative of the statistical thought process. Anything is measurable is the principle of mathematics. It also relates to statistics, the concept of measurement is well evident in the Ayurvedic treatises. The section Vimaanasthaana is developed around the focal theme of measurable variables and methods of measurement. A Vaidya must be well versed with method of measurement of all the variables like Dosha, drug, strength, diet etc. to be able to treat the diseases successfully. The measure is of three types quantitative [Dravyatah], qualitative [Gun`atah], and a combination of both [Ubhayatah]. For example, quantity of urine passed by a person in 24 hours is measured using the unit liters while its color, clarity, smell are compared to standards and noted; is an example of application of both types of measurement. Abhaava may be reflected as principle of Obsolon. Saankhya and Nyaaya Dars`hana_s introductory part authored by Annambhat`t`a is the root of logic and statistics. Many theories are proposed and established in this work. Deductive and inductive analysis methods are explained in detail well before the period of Aristotle. The concept of false positive and false negative results is defined in the same first chapter of Saankhyadars`hana, titled Tarkasamgraha. Forerunners of descriptive or inferential statistical methods are evident in Tarkasamgraha. But it cannot be compared to the statistics of todays era, which has proliferated into a huge science with many techniques of calculation, which leads to true knowledge. No formulae or such other parameters are evident in the treatises. These may be available in those days in texts of mathematics like Leelaavati by Bhaskaraachaarya. Therefore it can be said that the concept or theory of statistical phenomena too originated in ancient texts to a certain extent. Summary Intelligent minds trained in the current system of categorization of knowledge, try to analyze or judge the ancient texts for proofs of the extent and depth of knowledge find that the classification or contextual references seem different and therefore at times difficult to understand. But once the answers to the three scientific questions what, why and how are carefully gathered with a different arrangement of available literary data, the intellectual thought process of research in Ayurvedic texts lives up. There cannot be one to one matching of the methods in Ayurveda with those, which are practiced today. As mentioned in the introduction, there are no separate manuals on how to do research in Ayurveda as the manuals or books are available today. This is a literary review to analyze whether research thought was prevailing or not among the intelligent class of people practicing Ayurveda by using modern day understanding as a yardstick. Therefore this work is an inferential work put together by compiling and analyzing the available data from the main treatises. If someone wants to counter question about the actual records of researches conducted or any such supporting documents then I am afraid, it is not possible to provide any. It is the limitation of this literature. This literature is developed on the guidelines format and not of actual records. Moreover considering the time span through which this science moves it does not seem possible to maintain such records in manuscripts forms, as compared to todays advanced technology of writing and printing etc. There is no need for a learned man to say that after churning loads of data, one principle is established; for when a whole process is scrutinized it gives the crystal clear idea about the fact that how much churning or efforts have been put to generate so many treatises.

It emphasizes the need of statistics in such studies and helps to decide the exact nature, type and time of a typical medical experimentation. In addition, the information gathered through such experiments can be analyzed by various statistical techniques. Further, the modeling of specific phenomena by the use of Monte Carlo and / or statistical methods can be useful for the complete and detailed study of a particular treatment. Due to the uncontrolled deforestation for various purposes, raw material for the preparation of Ayurvedic drugs is rarely available resulting in high cost of drugs and experimentation. In the last part, the article discusses the need to build virtual laboratories so that such type of studies can become cost effective in terms of money, time etc. In recent years Ayurvedic treatments are getting their share of preference by many people over the other types of treatments. The main advantages of this treatment include the complete eradication of the disease without any side effects of the drug taken and unlike the cosmetic relief offered by other contemporary types of treatments, the Ayurvedic treatment give a permanent solution to your disease. However, many objections are raised against the Ayurvedic therapy (though some of them are found to be baseless) such as long duration of the treatment, subjectivity of the treatment i.e. the doses and drugs are specific varying from person to person, dietary restrictions and use of some poisonous substances in the preparation of Ayurvedic drugs. It is the consequence of these objections that the use of this therapy has become a limited one and people are reluctant to take this treatment and prefer the other types of treatments. Hence, to nullify and answer these objections, one has to do systematic studies and careful analysis of result has become absolutely necessary. The statistical methods, being the scientifically proven methods, can be used to fulfill this need of systematic analysis. The present article is divided into five parts: The first part gives the introduction while the need and choice of a specific type of experimentation in Ayurvedic studies has been discussed in the second part. The third part is devoted to consider how statistical tests are useful for analyzing the association between various factors on the effectiveness of the treatment. The method for testing the effectiveness of a newly developed drug/treatment is also indicated in this section. The projections and model building of various situations by statistical techniques has been discussed in the fourth part. The last part indicates the use of computer and statistics to increase the effectiveness of the studies. The question, which many times asked, is when to conduct experiments on animals (trials). The answer to this question is many folds, in general; it is better to conduct experiments on animals when the effectiveness of the treatment is under assessment. However, due to variety of practical difficulties, it is not possible to conduct the experiment every now and then and hence the above question can be reframed as when is it absolutely necessary to conduct the experiment. When one has sufficient earlier knowledge and / or documented evidences about the effectiveness of the treatment giving clear nod in favor of the treatment, then one can skip experimentation. But when a claim is made about the better effectiveness of newly invented treatment for the cure of some disease, or new combinations of some well known materials are to be tried out, it becomes absolutely essential to conduct experiments on animals and check whether one really gets the same results as been claimed. Also according to various certifying agencies and bodies such as food and drugs association (FDA), USA, accept the claim for newly developed medicine only when it has been clinically proved. The clinical results obtained should be statistically significant. Hence it has become mandatory for each treatment to undergo a clinical trial and also if one wants to popularize his / her treatment, it is better to follow these types of protocols. Once it is decided to conduct an experiment, a natural question which comes in is, how to experiment and analyze the generated information to draw useful conclusions. Here statistics play a very useful role in answering this query. It tells us how to experiment in a systematic way and how to analyze the generated information so as to draw conclusions. If the units on which the experiments are to be conducted are homogeneous in nature, then the results obtained are clear and one can draw conclusions very easily. However, in general, it is difficult to get homogeneous unit in sufficient number and experimental units have variations among them. Now, if after the administration of a particular treatment to such non-homogeneous units, different responses will be obtained from them and one may not be able to conclude whether it is due to the effect of the given treatment or due to the variation present in these units. To draw point at home, let us take an example: Suppose a group of n individuals suffering from underweight problem is selected and enima (Basti) treatment is administered to all of them. Further, let n1 of them show weight gain and n2 show no change (n=n1+n2). Then it is difficult to conclude on the basis of this information only about the effectiveness of the treatment. This is because an individual has its own tendency to react and response to the treatment depending upon its bio-chemical make up. If all of these individuals are having the same bio-chemical make up, then surely n1>n2 implies effectiveness while n1<n2 tell the otherwise story. Hence, if units are not homogeneous, more scientific methodology is needed to analyze such situations. Statistics fulfills this need with the technique called Design of Experiments demonstrating how to experiment and how to analyze the information. The technique is so powerful that one can make multiple comparison of the effectiveness of various treatments simultaneously. The technique works on its three basic principles 1. Randomization 2. Replications 3. Local control. Let us explain this in more details in case of Ayurvedic study. In Ayurveda, individuals are divided into three main categories called Prakriti as Vata, Pitta and Kapha. Their combination is also three i.e. the individual can be Vata-Kapha, Vata-Pitta etc. However, for the simplicity of the discussion, only three types are considered here. Thus, there is first source of variation namely the type of the individual and depending upon the Prakriti, an individual may give a different response to the same treatment. If this variation is not there and if all of them are of the same type, then there could be other major basic factors, which influence the effectiveness, say Agni. All of these may not be same on this characteristic. Hence the first step is to single out various characters which are having significant influence on the effectiveness of the treatment. These will act as the source of variations. Now, depending upon the number of the source of variations, one may use any of the following designs: Completely randomized design (CRD) : only variation due to treatment is the source variation. Randomized block design (RBD): Two sources of variation, one due to treatment + one additional due to the non-homogeneity of the experimental units. Latin Square design (LSD) : Three sources of variation, one due to treatment + two additional due to non-homogeneity Balanced incomplete block design factorial experiments etc. Consider the randomized block design with two sources of variations as indicated. The problem is to test whether all the treatments have the same effectiveness for the cure of underlying disease. Three principle of design can be applied as follows: Suppose there are n experimental units / individuals having the following break up Vaata Prakriti + Kapha Prakriti + Pitta Prakriti = Total N1  N2  N3  N Then all the individuals of the same Prakriti are grouped in to one group called block and each treatment is administered in each block. Which treatment is given to which individual is decided purely by random mechanism such as lottery methods by giving no preference to any one. Hence each treatment has replications equal to number of blocks. Then the data collected can be analyzed using F-test to conclude whether the effectiveness of the treatments is same or they differ. Similarly, working of the other designs can be discussed. Further, it may be possible that there is interaction effect of the two treatments i.e. more natural and more realistic e.g. It is well known that Tulsi, Jesthamadh and Souph are recommended in the treatment for cough and cold. However what one observes is that the drugs, which are prescribed, are the combinations of these in aqueous state or they are in the form of chewable tables. This is because their interaction has more effectiveness than individuals as far as curing ability is concerned. If one is also interested in testing whether there is significant effect of interaction, then one has to work with what are known as Factorial Experiments. Another example is of a liquid drug called Bhallatakasava which is prepared from Bhallataka, Haritaki, Amalaki, Guduchi and Loha Bhasma taken in appropriate proportion. Now each one of them has its effectiveness for the deficiency or trouble, however, Asava prepared with these individual ingredients taking together has wonderful results and is handy to use than these individuals and is frequency used in Ayurveda. Similarly once can take the examples of Kumariasava, Drakshasava and others. The examples discussed above are not new and everyone practicing in Ayurveda is already known their effectiveness. However, to draw the points, these examples are used so that the subject matter can be understood in a better way. Another possible use of Statistics is to quantity the data generated. After a fair amount of period from starting a Ayurvedic treatment one wants to know whether the treatment is going in a right direction or not. The only way to know this is to undergo suitable Pathological tests, however, many times these tests give results which are qualitative in nature i.e. positive or negative ness of the test and not recorded quantitatively. For the analysis of effectiveness, it is absolutely necessary to quantify the data and condense and present it in proper form. This can be illustrated with a following example: Consider a case of an individual under Ayurvedic treatment for the heart-related problem. After a sufficient time interval he/she undergoes a stress test and detected positive, then if the data are not quantitative, then one may think that the treatment is not useful. But if it is recorded that an individual has positive stress test for a comfortable walk of say 8 seconds before the treatment and after the treatment he/she has a stress test positive with a comfortable walking timing of 5 minutes, then one can immediately in which way the treatment is going. It may happen that after the second time, the test would be continued to be positive but with the comfortable walking timing of 8 minutes. Then this result sure indicates the effectiveness of the treatment. If this study is carried out for a group of individuals undergoing such treatment, then based on this data one can say something about the effectiveness of the treatment, in general. Same can be said about the lipid profile test and other tests for different diseases. Lastly let us look at another problem, which has more chance of occurring in Ayurvedic studies called missing observation. This can be described as follows: Suppose n individuals / units are selected for an experiment, which involves the study of the comparison of various treatments. The experiments are to be conducted for a specific duration. Now suppose due to negative canvassing or any other reasons, some individuals stop coming for the treatment and you have generated incomplete data with some missing observations. What one can do in such situation? Does all the efforts are in vain? Are we going to start a fresh? The answer is no. You do not have to do this once again. Statistics is at your help. The technique called the Missing Plot technique can help you to estimate these observations based on the data you have collected with a desirable accuracy. Using these estimated values at the place of missing observations, you can analyze the data and draw accurate conclusions. 3. Use of some Statistical Tests: Many times in Ayurvedic studies one has to detect association between various factors to answer the questions, which are of the following types: Does the effectiveness of the treatment depend upon the age? Do the stage of the disease in which an individual is has any influence on the effectiveness of the drug? Do I have to follow a strict vegetarian diet while undergoing an Ayurvedic treatment? A typical set of complaints, are they indicator of the possibility of a specific type of disease uniquely? Or in other words, do I become susceptible to a particular type of a disease? Do my typical type of life style make me more susceptible to a particular type of a disease? Etc. To answer above types of questions, one has to undertake the study in which responses could be of the qualitative nature. The response of an individual could be any one of the following: now in this particular study, one has to analyze qualitative characteristics (attributes). To answer all above questions, it is recommended to use a technique for the analysis of two attributes, namely chi-square (2) test for the association of attributes. E.g. let us look at the question (a) Here the first attribute would be A: Age of an individual and the second, B: Response to the treatment. The attribute A can have four levels say Child, Young, Middle aged and old aged (defined by taking appropriate age group) also attribute has four levels labeled by appropriate names. Then, the data can be summarized in the form of a 4 (4 table called as 4 ( 4 contingency table, Then, one can use chi-square test of association of two attributes in 4 ( 4 contingency table to conclude about the association). Similarly if one want to see whether there is any association between the dietary habits and effectiveness of the treatment, then attribute A has three levels: Vegetarian, non-vegetarian and mixed diet and the attribute b has four levels as earlier, then the data generated can be summarized in to 3 (4 contingency table and chi-square test for the association of attributes in 3 (4 contingency table can be use to analyze the data and conclusions can be drawn. Another situation wherein has to make use of a statistical test is when the effectiveness of one single treatment is to be assessed. The experiment can be conducted as follows: A group of n individuals / objects suffering from a particular disease is selected and the status of their health before the treatment and after a sufficient time interval of a particular given treatment is noted generating the data in the variable form. Let the health status before and after the treatment be denoted by X and Y respectively, then the data generated would be (Xi Yi), I = 1,2, ---- n wherein Xi = health status of ith individual before the treatment and Yi = Health status of ith individual after the treatment. Evaluate di = Xi  Yi = I = 1,2--- n. Based on these di values one can use pair t-test to analyze the data and conclude about the effectiveness of the treatment. Illustration: Suppose Basti treatment is recommended for gain in weight. A group of m individuals having underweight problem is selected. Let the weight before the treatment of each of these individuals be recorded as X1 ----- Xn. Basti is administered to all of them and then after a sufficient time interval, let the weight after the treatment for each of these individual be Y1 --- Yn. Then di = Xi  Yi, I= 1,2  n, then using these values and pair t-tst, one can conclude whether Basti is effective for increasing the weight. There could be a situation when one only wants to compare the effectiveness of two different treatments. There could be a situation in which it is required to test whether the Ayurvedic treatment is equally effective as compared to the other contemporary pathies for curing a typical type of a disorder. This is needed because many a times, false negative canvassing is done against Ayurveda by saying that our brand of treatment is better than Ayurveda and Ayurvedic treatment cant match our brand in power of curing the disorder. To answer this criticism, it is recommended to use what is called as two-sample t-test. The experimentation will be done as follows: Suppose we want to compare two brands, say A and B, a: Ayurvedic and B: Other brand. Administer treatment A to a group of n1 individuals and treatment B to a group of n2 individuals. N1 may or may not be equal to n2. Then using the data, calculate averages and dispersion for each of the two groups and using these and the mechanism of two-sample t-test one can conclude about the equality in effectiveness of the two treatments. Similarly there are other Statistical tests, which can be used in Ayurvedic studies as and when required. It is many times thought that various substances used in Ayurveda to prepare  Bhasma are poisonous and hence it is harmful to take such treatment. This has again turned out to be a baseless allegation against Ayurveda. However, one has disapprove this claim by using scientific methods. The typical examples are those of Mercury and Sulfur used in the preparation of Ayurvedic drugs curing various disorders. The experiment can be conducted as follows: Give different concentrations of such doses to the animals under observation and record their health status. It is well known that a specific type of enzyme secretion takes place in liver to encounter any poisonous element entering the body. Now, it is good to record the concentration of this enzyme secreted and its ability to nullify the poisonous effect. Now to know about the concentration of the above-mentioned drug that can be tolerated by the animal under study, is to keep on increasing the drug concentration till the animal dies and the dose at which an animal dies is the Threshold of tolerance. If this threshold is much higher than the amount of the element in the Ayurvedic drug, then the allegation is baseless. However, statistics provides a technique in which one can obtain this threshold without killing the animal. The procedure is as follows: Give various concentrations of doses to animals which are not too high and record the health status of the animal, denoted by X: Concentration of the dose and Y: Health status. Collect observations ( Xi, Yi), I = 1,2 --- n on each of the n animals. Then using a technique called method of least squares, one can obtain model Y=f(x) i.e. Y is a function of x. Then one can substitute various values of X which are much higher and see what are the corresponding values of Y. Also the function can be plotted and using graphical procedure, one can obtain the threshold dose. Thus, it saves the animal (experimental unit) and allegation can be disproved as earlier by comparing two values. This exercise is nothing but modeling the phenomenon under consideration and projecting Y values for given values of X. Second example wherein the projection and Modeling can be useful is that of deciding optimum dose of a treatment to cure a certain disorder. Let us explain this with an example: Again the illustration is taken to deliver a message rather than generating anything new. However, same experiment can be conducted for a new drug and conclusions can be drawn. Suppose an optimum dose for the treatment on diabetic disorder is to be decided. Further, let us assume that a new drug Madhumeharai is being designed to control this disorder and the optimum dose of this drug is to be found out. Now for various diabetic patients different intensity doses are being tried and data are recorded. X= Intensity of dose to bring down the blood sugar to a controlled range (non-diabetic zone) and Y = Initial blood sugar content. Then, using the method of least square technique, one can construct a model, X=g (Y), and for the given value of Y one can get the optimum value of the intensity of the dose. Lastly, give a mechanism to answer the question, how long should I continue my treatment for specific type disorder? Here also one can use the technique discussed earlier to obtain optimum duration for the cure. The variable here are: X = Initial state of the patient and Y = Duration of the treatment required for the cure. With the arrival of an information technology generation, it has become more simpler and less time consuming to make experiments. What one can do is to conduct a sort of pilot experiment on handful of objects for a manageable time span. Then supply this information to computer in the form of suitable database and then keep on simulated observation give you the output as if you have conducted the experiments under given conditions with desired accuracy. In this exercise, lot of money, energy and time is saved and once can generate as many observations as one ants. Thee are not the true observations but the simulated ones. Hence the experiments involving simulations are called virtual experiments and the system is the virtual laboratory. This type of technique is very useful in conducting the trials on newly invented drugs. One can generate real data by using low intensity doses on animals and then by simulating, picture can be projected about the situations when higher dose is administered. The discussion in earlier section about modeling and projection can be done very easily using computer and once a model is established it is easy to simulate the observation using this model. Hence, statistical techniques play a crucial role in constructing virtual laboratories. In the Ayurvedic experimental studies also one can prepare a data bank of various Ayurvedic treatments which are available for various disorders and prepare a expert system to guide the treatment for a particular disorder and the effect of which can be tested using techniques mentioned above. In all above discussion an attempt has been made to discuss the philosophy and logic behind various statistical techniques and their possible use in Ayurvedic experiments.

A condition or circumstance (not always adverse), which can disturb the normal physical and mental health of an individual. In medical parlance it can be defined as A physical and psychological response that results from being exposed to a demand or pressure.- Neurological Glossary Thompson & Gale This demand on mind-body occurs when it tries to cope with incessant changes in life. A 'stress' condition seems 'relative' in nature. Extreme stress conditions, psychologists say, are detrimental to human health but in moderation stress is normal and, in many cases, proves useful. Stress, nonetheless, is synonymous with negative conditions. Today, with the rapid diversification of human activity, we come face to face with numerous types of stress and depression. Right from the childhood up to the old age everyone is facing various kind of stress. Stressed out and negligent parents, high expectations in academic or other performances, abused or deprived childhood, growing up tensions and demand for familial responsibility are the main causes of childhood and teen stress. Growing up can be a difficult experience for both males and females. During this period, rapid physical transitions necessitate transition in a child's mental make-up, its attitude towards people and circumstances. Children are often ill equipped to cope with stress during these transitions from a child to pre-adolescence, and from pre-adolescence to adolescence phases.   For pre-adolescents and teens, an identity crisis, the perils of peer interaction, acceptance and rejection ofsituations, persons and ideasare a constant source of teen stress and teenage depression. Stress is created by parental pressure to perform every time and to stand out among other children. When they can't rise up to that expectation, or during the process of meeting it, children may suffer from frustration, physical stress, aggression, undesirable complexes, and depression.   Students who are under-performers, develop negative traits such as shyness, unfriendliness, jealousy, and may retreat into their own world to become loners. The young or the post educational years are marked by stress of getting good jobs and then coping with the good job and demands (physical / psychological) of the same. The old age is marked by the stress due to loneliness, physical debility etc. In todays era everyone has to face stress throughout his life. This is a consequence of modernization. We must find some concrete solution to overcome the stress and related problems. In Ayurved we find detail information about stress as an etiological factor. Stress can be defined as any type of derangement in the functions (thinking, decision making etc) and powers (Dhee, Dhriti and Smriti) of mind. C.Sha.1/102 It is mentioned that any perturbation in the powers of mind (Dhee, Dhriti, Smriti) lead to Pradnyaaparaadha and it is the root cause of all diseases. We can include the following Hetu related to Mana mentioned in Ayurved under stress Achintaa, Asooyaa, Bhaya, Chintaa, Chitta Viparyaya, Durmanastva, Eechchhaa, Eershyaa, Kaama, Krodha, Lajjaa, Laulya, Lobha, Moha, Pradnyaaparaadha, S`hoka, Sankshobha, Udvega, Vishaada In Ayurveda Chintaa is mentioned as a cause of following diseases Aamadosha, Apasmaara, Hridroga, Kaars`hya, Beejopaghaataja Klaibya, Dhaatukshayaja Klaibya, Peenasa Naasaa Roga, Timira Drisht`igata Netra Roga, Nidraanaas`ha, Paan`d`u, Raajayakshmaa, Stanya Dusht`i, Tandraa, Vaataja Unmaada, Vaatavyaadhi. The common symptoms of stress can be identified as The psychological symptoms Anxiety, Restlessness, Worrying, Irritability, Depression, Sadness, Anger, Mood swings, Feeling of Insecurity, Lack of concentration, Confusion, Forgetfulness, Resentment, Tendency to blame others for what you feel, Tendency to see only negative aspects of people and situations, Guilt etc. The physical symptoms Heart Pounding, Sweating of palms, indigestion, skin breaks out, shortness of breath, holding breath, headaches. Stress can act as an etiological factor for some diseases like irritable bowel syndrome, eating disorder, allergies, insomnia, backaches, frequent cold, fatigue, hypertension, asthma, diabetes, heart ailments and even cancer. Management of Stress First of all it is very much important to diagnose whether stress manifests as a disease on its own or manifests as some other disease like Prameha or Hridroga. The management changes accordingly. If it manifests as a stress alone then the following is the line of treatment. But if it manifests as another disease then along with the next mentioned treatment the specific treatment of the disease should also be followed. Therapeutic management This includes the formulations like Medhya Rasaayana, Braahma Rasaayana, Chyavanapraas`ha and single drugs like Jat`aamaamsee, Braahmee. Procedural management This includes the major procedures like Vamana, Virechana and Basti according to the S`haareera Dosha vitiation. But the more effective procedures are the procedures like Snehana, Svedana, Abhyanga, S`hirobhyanga, S`hirodhaaraa, S`hirobasti and Nasya. Dietary management Cow milk, Ghee, the diet should contain naturally available food stuffs. The rules of preparation, combination, quantity and suitability for own should be followed rigorously. Counseling - Satvaavajaya Chikitsaa This includes As`hvaasana Chikitsaa, Mantra, Japa, Poojana Healthy Conduct In Ayurved many specific conducts are described which have importance in social as well as individual health care. Day to day - Dinacharyaa As per season - Ritucharyaa Generalized social code of conduct Aachaara Rasaayana. Suppressible urges Gradual withdrawal of inappropriate & acquiring appropriate Relaxation techniques Physical exercises, Praan`aayaama, meditation, Listening to soothing music, Visualization Prophylactic Treatment - Ayurved always emphasizes the importance of maintenance of health than the cure of diseases. Considering this Ayurved suggests following conduct for prevention of diseases of mind such as stress. A.H.Su.1/26 Dhee This is the intellect which decides which factors from the environment are beneficial and which are harmful to our body. Dhairya This is the strength of mind which helps us to acquire the beneficial and refuse the harmful things.

Agni is defined as Nayate Parin`aamayateeti That is the one which brings about the transformation of consumed Aahaara Vihaaraadi Dravya of Vijaateeya (incompatible) origin to Sajaateeya (homogeneous) nature. Agni Gun`ajanakamevacha Na Dravyajanakam| Chakrapaan`ee Agni brings about a change of qualities i.e. Gurvaadi Gun`a, but never produces a new substance or Dravya. So it is the factor responsible for bringing about the breakdown and synthesis of substance. All changes occurring at macroscopic, inorganic, organic levels are due to Paakakarma of Agni. The metabolism occurs at three levels. First is the basic metabolism occurring inside the gastrointestinal tract for which Jaat`haraagni is responsible. Then the one occurring at more subtle level that is at the elemental level by Bhautikaagni. Last is the digestion occurring inside the Srotas i.e. at the cellular level, responsible for the production of Dhaatu the body constituents by Dhaatvagni. The life of a human being is dependant upon the strength of the Agni. Agni is a prime over and also the ultimate factor in the process of sustenance of life.

Any type of malfunction of Agni i.e. Manda / Vishama / Teekshn`a leads to formation of Aama (undigested food / chyme) in the body. The partially digested food remaining in the gastro intestinal tract due to weaker digestive power is called Aama .This Aama is considered as the root cause of many diseases. To avoid this one should always try to preserve the strength of Agni. C.Chi.15/4 So quality and life span of an individual depends upon the strength of Agni.

The dictionaries available may disseminate little by stating that these are the technical words in Ayurveda. Attempt to use the Samskrita roman dictionary may put the reader in a puzzle Dosha is fault, Dhaatu is metal, Mala is waste, the reading of which does not help in any way. Ayurvedic seers after observation, state that the body is comprised of three functionally distinct components. Their physical characters may not be similar even though they are put in one group. The tissues namely serum, blood cells, muscles, fat, bones, brain and spinal cord occupying the hollow in head and vertebral column and masculine and feminine components to form new child, have quite different physical characteristics. But as all of them stay on in the body, and do not leave the body naturally; they are put in one group. This group is distinct from the naturally thrown away components like stools, urine, sweat, nails, hair, gases; the getting rid of these in stipulated periods, adds to the comfort level of the body. If the tissues leave the body by accident, the body is not comfortable; but is anxious, exhausted and fatigued. The body is formed by the naturally retained tissues and the naturally destined to leave the body, the waste products. The Dhaatu term is given to all components that stay in / on the body and losing them decreases the capacity of the body to sustain. If by natural development, the tissues group membranes are weak; the capacity of the body to ward off causes of diseases is decreased. The body, by lesser units of Dhaatu_s, is easily vulnerable to the wrath of causes of disease. By appropriate quantity, tissues increase / protect the chances of continuation of life, as they provide the capacity to exert, and sustain life for physiological requirements). Waste products are formed out of digestion of food intake and are destined to leave the location, organ and help the body to be more efficacious by separation. If they dont leave the organ they render the part or body dirtier than before. The useful function of the body or related part becomes a burden for the body. The over stayed waste/s weaken/s the capacity and provides facilities to progress of disease. The Mala_s are of gaseous, liquid, fluid, watery, solid nature, in their physical characters. But the function of elimination from the body for the benefit of the body is common in all. But both these characteristics of classification, based on functions, are defied by another group of body components. The saliva that appears in the mouth crosses the tissue compartment, but it does not essentially leave the body. By moistening the intake (toast, biscuit) it once again enters in, through absorption. The character of the tissues to be within the limit of the skin and inside linings is ignored, by crossing the salivary glands, but even though the circulatory system is left, the secretion re-enters along with environmental intake for the benefit of the body. Had the defying of Dhaatu character not taken place, the environmental material could not have the chance of getting in contact of digesting /absorbing system of the body. After separation, if the one does not leave the body; and even though 9968`actually coming out from systems, as waste or (Mala) it is not fully destined to get separated from the body. Not obeying the definitions of both Dhaatu and Mala is the specificity of Dosha_s. While catching a prey, the eater has to exert himself where the tissues from the body are separated (spent) in performing the exertion; but this spending is done for bringing nourishing material in the vicinity of moistening, digesting and absorbing systems. This initial separating of existing tissues is favoring the provision of the next days requirements. So the actions initiated, the secretions lent for moistening and digestion together; are of prime importance in routine survival efforts. Ayurvedic scientists have therefore aptly named the third functional group, Dosha_s as 3 pillars of the body. It defies the nature of both Dhaatu_s and Mala_s. But this group comprising of different physical characters, (actions for capturing from environment first, and later on activity for absorption after moistening and digesting) non-dimensional, watery fluids and colourful digesting fluids, they are put in the Dosha class very appropriately. They receive the environmental air-mixture, water, and food for the welfare of the body. Out of three (retained, excreted, and dual role players), Dosha_s are more important than Dhaatu_s and Mala_s. The comparison of these entities to the environmental components has given the names of Vaata i.e. responsible for capture, absorption; Pitta for variety of conversions and Kapha for newer inter linking functions. As some ingredients reach in more quantity inside the tissue zone; the body canalizes those unwanted fractions, through Dosha_s. By this mechanism the tissues are protected for being more efficient. If one repeatedly takes spicy ketchup in excess quantity than the requirement of the body; the components of ketchup start getting re-excreted in the mouth, stomach, duodenum. The individual is given proper signal that the material being consumed out of liking is in a proportion not to the benefit of the body. The tissues are throwing out the excess components through natural outlets. This is a very important sign for getting aware of the situation inside the tissues, without inflicting upon the tissues. The material not wanted by the body is let out, through channels of Dosha. The knowledge is useful to assess the situation inside. The Dosha_s appear in their respective locations in the gastrointestinal tract two times in a span of 24 hours. The excreted material at times may be irritating sour or pungent, at other times sweet and sticky in nature. This indication naturally monitors the changed desires and hatred of different substances, for retrieving the erred balance. By modification of intake the tissues are protected from being overwhelmed by the disease provoking substances. The environ is full of so many modifications of hot, cold, moist, dry stimuli which causes modifications in the quality and quantities of such indicating substances. So to push in or take out materials from inside the tissues Dosha_s are important in non-invasive ways. For this very important function the Dosha_s are given top most weight age in body components. The Ayurvedic specialty Panchakarma aims at enhancing the natural movement of Dosha_s for bulk removal, so that the augmentation of disease is curbed at the root. Identifying the Prakriti specific dominance of one or two Dosha`s is the most effective tool of managing health by continuous efforts to antagonize the dominant Dosha_s. The tolerance of various substances to build the tissues is dependant on the dominance of Dosha_s in the individual. The choice of rejuvenating material when done by consideration of dominant Dosha is advantageous.

It refers to the inborn set of physical and psychological properties, which are decided at the time of conception. The moment of conception is very important as the individual comes into being as a homogeneous, whole entity from six diverse entities, namely the soul, mind, the maternal and paternal seeds, the Rasa and a congenial internal milieu, which is conducive for the conception, called Saatmya (homologation). The event is characterized by a concurrent convergence of all these six to form the foetus, which exhibits the following features. This determines the growth and life span of a person to a large extent and the psychological behaviour to a lesser extent. It includes the physique, build, complexion, voice, gait, nature, hair, colour, appetite / digestive capacity, proneness to various disorders etc. This is a result of a heightened activity of one or more of the Dosha_s predominant in S`hukra (sperm) and S`hon`ita (ovum) at the time of conception. This is a result of the activity of the three Gun`a_s at the time of conception. The mental state of the parents predisposes the foetus. These mental states have been divided into three main categories, namely Sattva, Raajas and Taamas, which are further classified into sixteen subtypes. They mainly describe the persons psychological build up and the physique is not of much concern in this. After fertilization the remaining part of the S`hukra which resembles to Ojas very closely, is retained as Para Ojas. This amount sees the foetus through the initial seven-month period of the intrauterine growth, at the end of which the Garbha (foetus) can start manufacturing its own Apara Ojas. This factor is responsible for the progression of the life. We shall now discuss the roles played by the three Mahaa Gun`a_s namely Sattva, Rajas and Tamas in the manifestation of an individual characterized by various attributes and functions .Based on this background we shall try and understand the sixteen subtypes of Maanasika Prakriti. The nature of Sattva Rajas and Taamas Sattva Sattva is considered blemish less and healthy. It leads one to attachment of the knowledge. Sattva gives rise to happiness. When Sattva predominates, it leads to correct knowledge. Saattvika mentality leads to actions performed with selflessness noble motives, to actions, which are non-egoistic, performed with firmness and enthusiasm. The doer is unaffected by the success or the failure of his efforts .He retains the sense of balance. Raajas Raajas gives rise to passion and the source of feeling of longings and attachment. It leads one to attachment with action when Rajas predominates; it leads to hasty initiation of action restlessness and longing. Raajasika mentality leads one to action that is performed for specific effects and performed ostentatiously. Raajasika acts are driven by strong passion to see results and they may be harmful. The doer is swayed intensely by joy or sorrow depending on the result of the action. Taamasa Taamasa gives rise to indolence and sleep. It leads to inertia. When Taamasa predominates, it leads to heedlessness and delusion. Taamasika mentality leads to action performed in lackadaisical manner without sincerity of purpose and devotion. Taamasika actions are unsteady. They may be malicious and may involve despondency and procrastination. Sattva is of high quality and tends to be uplifting in nature Raajasa has high quality of movement and energy. Taamasa has high quality of heaviness and inertia. However all three of them can do act in conjunction and combination. The Saatvika temperament is free from defects and it is endowed with good effects. The Raajasika type is defective since it promotes wrathful disposition hastiness in action anger etc. Similarly, the Taamasika disposition is defective since it represents ignorance inertia etc. Each of these three types of mind can occur in an infinite numbers of variations on account of differentiating factors like the degree origin, body and the mutual concomitance of the body and mind. Thus, we commonly find that a particular type of body goes well with a particular type of mental setup and conversely a particular mental setup would go well, with a particular type of physical body. In order to illustrate this point further we shall enumerate various sub-divisions of the three major types listed. Types of Sattva Indra is a deity who is lord / king of Gods a position he has achieved by sheer determination, perseverance and by defending his goal with fervor. One attains this post of Aindra after performing 100 Ashwamedha Yajna_s (an elaborate sacrificial ritual). Therefore a person who harbors such an ambition and is sure of attaining it in his lifetime, definitely has very long and clear foresight, a clear idea of what is involved in the chosen task. He is ready to pay the price for his goal and will not let anyone or anything come in his way. He will not tolerate any insubordination in this endeavour and will rule with an iron hand, but he will not exceed the limits laid down by Dharma. Hence, when we come across a person who is ambitious but believes in fair play, is forthright in his expression, has clearly defined ideas about his goals and how to achieve them, we can be sure that we are dealing with an Aindra type of mental constitution. A water-loving person, transparent in his actions, not afraid to be angry or to declare his pleasure if the cause is just, is clean himself and abhors uncleanness is of Varun`a type. Varun`a is a deity who governs water and water being a universal solvent is extensively used as a purifying agent. Lord Kubera is the treasurer of the Gods. Therefore, he is looked after very well by attendant. All these qualities described above can ruin a person if the inherent strength of the person is lacking. Since this is a Sattva predominant individual, the status, honour etc. do not allow him to deviate from his duties as a treasurer. He behaves as a keeper and any lapse in carrying out duties invites his wrath. A job well done, commands his pleasure instantaneously. He carries himself well and with confidence. These seven types of mental constitutions are mainly Sattvika in nature and we see a gradual dilution from a serene, type devoted to knowledge acquisition and dissemination, in an unattached objective manner to a happy go luckily, indulgent type of person. However, this toning down is still in the purview of Sattva and therefore it is benign and not harmful to others. Types of Raajas Due to the predominance of Raajas we have six psychological constitutions. As we have seen before, Raajas is responsible for activity, initiation of movement etc. The persons are more active, emotional and generally are impatient. Aasura Type: A person who is violent, short-tempered, volatile, envious, wields authority is terrifying, pitiless, and ruthless, indulges in self-adulation, has one heavy meal a day and has a prominent belly is known to be of Aasura type. These persons cannot tolerate prosperity, growth of others, are envious of the same, do not have any scruples or qualms about others feelings. Cheating and lying come easily to them. They would be magnanimous to a person accepting their superiority. The mind is continuously occupied with scheming, therefore the Aasura type does not eat properly and has only one square meal, a substantial meal a day. In the matter of his survival, he is merciless. He gives into anger very soon because of this, people tend to avoid confronting him and he enjoys a position of authority. Raakshasa Type: A person who is intolerant, has long drawn anger, bides for time, seeks an opportunity and strikes when the opponent is most vulnerable, is cruel, a longer, doesnt believe in a code of conduct, is gluttonous, loves meat, loves sleep, doesnt tire easily is known to be of Raakshasa type. These persons wait for an opportunity to strike, they are revengeful, they love their own sleep and food, they hate to be disturbed while asleep and during meals and they do not believe in ethics. If objected to they let their anger take over. This makes them not very popular and they do not like and are not comfortable in the company of normal people. Pais`haachcha Type: A Pis`hachcha type is one who devours large amount of food, is of easy virtue, loves to be in the company of the opposite sex, loves loneliness, is unclean and hates cleanliness in any form, hence is obnoxious to others, is a coward and bully, has unnatural and out of the ordinary like for food or whose behaviour is abnormal and is shameless. Sarpa Type: A person who is brave when angry or incited but a coward normally, touchy, doesnt tire easily, arouses few in his opponent, loves food, indulges in gratification of various desires and is a fast eater is known to be of the Sarpa type. These people normally tend to avoid confrontation but if provoked they would be really angry and would not retire easily, would successfully induce fear into the minds of their opponents. Normally they do not like any attention focused on to them. They prefer to be inconspicuous and tend to gulp their food down. They are industrious in nature and they see the job through. Preta Type: A person who lives for his food, whose every act ends up being painful for him, who is envious, who hates sharing his things, is very possessive, covetous, who hates work, is said to belong to the Preta type. These persons are immature, lack motive and self-confidence their actions end up causing sorrow to them. The lack of ingenuity makes them hold on to their possessions with all their might and this makes them envious of others, who are prosperous and confident. This envy is not converted to any revengeful action due to lack of initiative and action S`haakuna Type : Persons who are preoccupied with gratification of sexual desire, have short relationships, who enjoy their food, drink and various desires, are fickle, intolerant, live for the moment, do not like to acquire and provide for the future owing to lack of foresight are said to belong to the S`hakuna type. These type of persons are like birds, they are of fickle mind, they do not tend to learn from the experience of the past, have a very dim vision of the present, are concerned with baser instincts like hunger and procreation. Hence, they do not plan for the future and should an emergency arise they do not have contingency plans with them. Types of Taamas A predominance of Taamas at the time of conception in varying degrees gives rise to three psychological constitutions. They are as follows: Paas`hava Type: A person who is disrespectful, unintelligent, dull, disgusting in his behaviour and eating habits, abundant in his sexual behaviour and somnolent in his habits. These persons like animals are devoid of normal feelings of propriety, respect, cleanliness etc. They are obnoxious, dull in their intellect, sense, actions and unfit for any responsible post. They prove to be good manual workers where no decision, responsibilities, or managerial skills are required of them. They do well under a strict ruthless supervisor. This is known as Paas`hava type of psychological constitution. Maatsya Type: One who constantly lives in fear, is stupid, unintelligent, greedy for food, has an unstable mind, strong and persistent likes and dislikes, likes to move constantly, cover long distances, who is fond of water is said to belong to Maatsya type. Since these persons enjoy mobility they work well as travelling salespersons, but because of their lack of intelligence their liking for food and bickering nature, they should not be allowed to work, as a team and a strict schedule should be assigned to them without much margin and with a deadline and an incentive. The incentive should preferably be in the form of food. Vaanaspatya Type: People who are lazy, whose whole purpose of life seems to be confined to eating and who are completely devoid of all the higher mental faculties are known as the Vaanaspatya type. These persons due to extreme lack of motive, initiative, intelligence, have no desire to learn or better their lot and being devoted only to food are the worst of the lot. Their extreme reluctance to move makes it impossible for them to be gainfully employed anywhere. They would be total misfits for anything and everything without their being aware of their fate These sixteen types are what are known as psychological constitutions. If we are interested enough and keen in our observation, we are sure to find people around us who fit into one of these categories. If taken into account while considering prospective candidates for a particular job the problems arising out of a wrong selection could be avoided to a large extent resulting in increased productivity and efficiency and a more congenial atmosphere at the place of work.  Mental disposition forms a continuum with innumerable varieties and what we have described here are only certain ideal forms. These mentalities are perhaps best understood by citing examples of well-known characters. For example it is said that in the Raamayana, the three brothers Vibheesan`a, Raavan`a and Kumbhakarn`a epitomize the three qualities of Sattva,Raajas and Taamas. Vibheeshan`a who is virtuous in thoughts, speech and action gives sound advice to his brother Raavan`a and then he surrenders to Lord Rama. This is an example of Saatvika behaviour Raavan`a acts under the forces of lust and uncontrolled passion. His actions are ill considered and his behaviour haughty and arrogant. His behaviour is controlled by Raajas. The third brother Kumbhakarn`a has an extraordinary quality. He sleeps for six months at a time. The Yuddha Kan`d`a of Ramayana describes at great length the extraordinary efforts that have to be made to wake up the sleeping Kumbhakarn`a. They use elephants and spears to pound on him and blow the sound of trumpets and conches at his ears to wake him up. This is a typical quality of Taamas inertia, excessive sleep, sloth and ignorance.

It expresses unique trait of an individual that is defined by specific and permanent composition of Dosha at conception. The word Prakriti is derived from Pra + Kri (to create or to act). Prakriti means constitution, disposition or fundamental form  . Basic entity responsible for creation of Universe is called as Prakriti . Saamkhya and Sushruta describe it as Avyakta Prakriti or Moola Prakriti the state of equilibrium of Trigun`a  . Charaka explains Asht`adhaa Prakriti as Panchatanmaatraa + Ahamkaara + Mahat + Avyakta  . Though the word Prakriti is referred in many contexts, focus of this article is Deha Prakriti or Dosha Prakriti . (Chart no. 1) Tridosha and Trigun`a- Basis of Prakriti: Tridosha are basic factors responsible for health and disease. Dosha are biological expression of Mahaabhoota. They govern all functions of body and mind but on vitiation produce diseases. Vaata, Pitta and Kapha are three Dosha. Each Dosha possesses specific Gun`a or attributes. These attributes are defined according to pharmacological actions and form base for diagnosis, treatment and diet and lifestyle advice. Vaata is Rooksha (Dry), Laghu (Light), Chala (Mobile), S`heeghra (Swift), S`heeta (Cool), Parusha (Rough). Pitta is Tikshn`a (Penetrating), Ushn`a (Hot), Visra (Having musty smell), Drava (Liquid). Kapha has Snigdha (Unctuous), Guru (Heavy), Manda (Slow) and Sthira (Stable) attributes. These attributes of Dosha are expressed in physical and psychological characteristics. Sattva, Rajas and Tama are Trigun`a. These are mainly psychological attributes, which also affect physical characteristics. Satva is related to consciousness, intelligence, perception and memory, Rajas is responsible for kinetic energy and impetus; Tamas is mass, inertia and responsible for stability  . These Gun`a are expressed in characters of body and mind, as Prakriti is manifestation of composition of Dosha with specific Gun`a. Prakriti assessment is not only categorization of individuals based on phenotypes but also evaluation of these attributes to estimate dominance of particular Dosha or Gun`a. Prakriti is formed at fertilization and Dosha status of male and female gamete play important role. There are other factors, which influence Prakriti determination. Foetus has inherited characters from father (Pitrija), mother (Maatrija), Soul (Aatmaja), mind (Satvaja), diet (Rasaja) and homologation (Saatmyaja). Characters of individuals are resultant of these factors  . Charaka has categorized influencing factors in to four types as  : S`hukras`hon`ita Prakriti (Characters from father and mother) Kaalgarbhaas`haya Prakriti (season and uterine environment) Maaturaahaara Vihaara Prakriti (diet and lifestyle of mother) Pancha Mahaabhoota Vikaara Prakriti (attributes of Mahaabhoota ) All these factors affect the genesis of Prakriti. Vaagbhat`a and Sus`hruta emphasize on inherited characters from parents while Charaka, Kaaashyapa and others highlight more on environmental factors for Prakriti determination. Naagaarjuna believes environmental factors in course of intrauterine life affect Prakriti. Kaas`hyapa Samhitaa has emphasized importance of diet of mother  . According to Bhela Samhitaa, diet and lifestyle of father and mother affect Prakriti of offspring  . Charaka Samhitaa describes method of procreation and development of healthy child by controlling possible affecting factors  . The process for elective pregnancy includes Panchakarma and Vaajikaran`a to produce healthy gametes. Procedures like Pumsamvana, Garbhasthaapana and Garbhin`ee Paricharyaa (Obstetric nursing guidelines) are meant for equilibrium of Dosha for healthy child. Other factors are important for Prakriti assessment. They are quoted by Charaka Jaatiprasaktaa (Characters linked to race) Kulaprasaktaa (Familial characters) Deshaanupaatinee (Characters related to geographical or agro-climatic location) Kalaanupaatinee (Seasonal variations at the time of conception) Vayaanupatinee (Characters dependent on age or stages of life) Pratyaanmitaa (Individual variations despite of any similarity) These criteria define baseline for Prakriti assessment and needs methodical attention. For example, average height and weight of Punjabi and Nepali are different; diet habits are specific for some communities. Considering above variables, each needs different weightage and generalized approach sometimes leads to confusion or false positive / negative results. Types of Prakriti: Types of Prakriti based on Tridosha, Trigun`a and Mahaabhoota are termed as Dehaprakriti, Maanasprakriti and Bhautikprakriti respectively.  Deha Prakriti Prakriti with reference to Dosha is known as Doshaprakriti or Dehaprakriti as it expresses mainly physical characters. Ekdoshja (One Dosha ) types are concerned with one dominant Dosha they are three Vaata Pitta - Kapha, Dvidoshaja types exhibit dominance of two Dosha and they are three (Vaata Pitta PittaKapha - KaphaVaata ) while Sama Prakriti has three Dosha in balanced state. Thus there are 7 types of Dehaprakriti.  Maanas Prakriti. : Maanasa Prakriti also has seven types as Dehaprakriti. It is also known as Gun`aprakriti, Mahaprakriti or Chittaprakriti and mainly deals with attributes of mind. Charaka and Sushruta further subdivide Maanasprakriti into 16 categories  . (Chart No. 2)  Bhautika Prakriti. : Classification of Prakriti based on dominance of Mahaabhoota is termed as Bhautikprakriti by Sushruta  . Attributes of respective Mahaabhoota reveal five types of constitutions. Vaayaveeya Prakriti has similar characters as Vaata Prakriti, Tejas Prakriti is similar to Pitta Prakriti and Aapya Prakriti resembles Kapha Prakriti. Paarthiva Prakriti has Sthira, Vipula S`haarira (stable and large body) and Kshamaavana (has forgiveness). Naabhasa (Aakaasheeya) Prakriti has large cavities and live longer and follow purity. Definitions of Prakriti: Prakriti is specific composition of Dosha that is permanent throughout the life. Dominance (Utka`ta) and unchangeable (Avyaabhichaari) nature of Dosha are called as Prakriti  . Status of Dosha at conception determines Prakriti. Though Dosha are dominant, they do not cause diseases but they are well tolerated being congenital in nature. Charaka specifies Sama Dosha as Sama Prakriti , in which Dosha are in state of equilibrium. Others are not termed as Prakriti but called as Vaatala, Pittala and S`hleshmala (and not Vaataprakriti etc.). Charaka considers Prakriti as normal state hence describes Sama as only Prakriti. Sushruta describes Dosha s elevated (Utkat`a) but within normal limits  . According to Asthanga Hridaya, in any Prakriti, Dosha are elevated but well tolerated and do not cause abnormality  . Dosha are classified in two components: Prakrita and Vikrita Dosha. Prakrita Dosha are congenital, maintain homeostasis, regulate physiological processes and responsible for health. Vikrita Dosha are generated in metabolic processes and are responsible for diseases. Prakrita Dosha are responsible for Prakriti hence it is unchangeable and constant nature of an individual. Dosha, though dominant are in physiological limits in Prakriti, abnormal (either Kshaya, Vriddhi or Prakopa) in diseased state and completely changed in Arisht`a (alarming signs of death or grave prognosis of disease)  . Charaka, Sushruta, Vaagbhat`a and other Samhitaa describe guidelines for Prakriti assessment. Characters of Vaata, Pitta and Kapha Prakriti are described in details, based on which physician examines dominance of Vaata, Pitta, and Kapha. These characters can be divided into anatomical, physiological and psychological variables. Charaka explains assessment of Prakriti based on Gun`a and describes manifestation of each Gun`a separately. For example, Vaata Prakriti is illustrated on the basis of Rooksha, Laghu, Chala, S`heeghra, S`heeta, Parusha, Vishada, Alpa Gun`a  . Each Gun`a is responsible for specific characteristics. (Table no. 1) Sushruta and Vaagbhat`a, Haarita, Bhaavmishra and Shaarangdhara describe Prakriti based on anatomical, physiological and psychological characters. Sushruta and Vaagbhat`a (Samgraha and Hridaya) have added numerous objective parameters as: cracked legs and feet and developed calf muscles of Vaata Prakriti, coppery hair and laxity of joints for Pitta Prakriti, long arm, broad chest and muscular body of KaphaPrakriti . Dreams, liking and disliking of different Prakriti have elucidated by other Samhitaa  , , . Shaarangdhara has listed few parameters for quick assessment of Prakriti  . Sushruta and Vaagbhat`a have linked Prakriti with some animals or birds based on similarity of characters 22, 23 . This similarity is termed as Anookatva and explained as - Vaata Prakriti personality is analogous to goat, jackal, dog etc; Pitta Prakriti is similar to cobra, owl, cat etc and Kapha Prakriti resembles swan, elephant, lion etc. Apart from these characters; history, compatibility, proneness, lifestyle, diet and other aspects are considered with structured clinical examination. Role of lifestyle, occupation and many other causative factors requires appropriate credit. Thus Prakriti is retrospective evaluation of Gun`a based on clinical examination of an individual. Prakriti in health and diseases: Knowledge about Prakriti is prerequisite for assessment of Vikriti (pathology) hence it is important for diagnosis and therapeutics  . Treatment is called as Prakriti Sthaapana as it reverse pathology and restores Prakriti. Primary objective of Prakriti assessment is to estimate Bala Pramaan`a and Dosha Pramaan`a of an individual  . Bala Pramaan`a refers to judgment of physical and psychological potential that illustrates status of Dosha, Dhaatu, Mala and related organs. Assessment of Dosha Pramaan`a is associated to nature and extent of Dosha. Thus, concept of Prakriti is important in preventive and curative aspects. Prakriti assessment is a part of Das`havidha Parikshaa (10-point evaluation) and is considered in totality with understanding of other minimum nine aspects.  Prakriti as part of Das`havidha Parikshaa: Ayurvedic classics like Charaka Samhitaa and Sus`hruta Samhitaa have recommended extensive guidelines for assessment of disease (Vyaadhi) and diseased (Rugn`a). These guidelines aim at precise understanding of physiology and pathology; hence are applied to healthy individuals (Svastha) for Prakriti assessment. Prakriti assessment is a part of patient examination (Das`havidha Parikshaa) and that needs consideration of other factors, like Vikriti (pathology), Dhaatusaarataa (status of tissues), Samhanana (compactness), Pramaan`a (quantitative examination of organs), Aahaarshakti (digestive capacity), Vyaayaamashakti (capacity of exercise), Bala (strength), Kala (season) and Vaya (age). Considering all these dimensions, physician defines patient status, which forms base of treatment. Prakriti evaluation coupled with all above factors gives complete information on which treatment (or health advice) is based. Thus Ayurveda emphasizes evaluation of patient in totality for perfect diagnosis, management of health and disease. Role in health: Preventive aspect: Prakriti has decisive role in Swasthavritta (restoration of health), which is the prime objective of Ayurveda  . Prakriti based guidelines for diet and lifestyle result in healthy tissues and homeostasis of Dosha. Diagnostic aspect: Prakriti forms basis for understanding Sampraapti (pathology), extent and Vikalpana (combinations) of vitiated Dosha and status of host factors. Prediction of proneness and severity of disease can be speculated that helps in prognosis judgment  . Disease is a result of complex interplay between causative agents, environmental and host factors hence there are multiple factors that decide disease proneness. Hence to speculate disease proneness, other factors as causative factors (Hetu), immunity (Dhaatubala) etc should be considered, however some generalized assumptions can be made. Sama Prakriti has good resistance and generally not prone to diseases. Other types are labelled as Aatura (diseased), as they have dominance of one or more Dosha and need regular preventive measures. Out of rest six types, Prakriti with one Dosha (Ek Doshaja) have better resistance than two Dosha Prakriti (Dvi Doshaja). Vaata, Pitta and Kapha Prakriti are susceptible to disease in decreasing order  . Manifestation of disease in different Prakriti will be different though causative factors are comparable. Similar Dosha in Prakriti and Sampraapti (pathology) leads to severe disease. Vaata, Pitta and Kapha Prakriti individuals may have severe Vaata, Pitta and Kapha disease respectively. These assumptions are based on presence of potent and similar Hetu (causative factors). For example, Kaphavardhaka Hetu (excess Guru, Snigdha, Manda etc. Gun`a) cause severe Kapha disease to Kapha Prakriti individual  than any other Prakriti. Prakriti is important for judgement of prognosis. If Vikaara Prakriti (nature of disease) and Prakriti are similar then disease is difficult to manage (Kashtasaadhya). When Prakriti and disease are of different origin, it is easy to manage (Sukhasaadhya)  . Kaas`hyapa Samhitaa has defined role of season (KaalaPrakriti) in relation to Prakriti. If season, disease and Prakriti are of same Dosha, disease is untreatable and has bad prognosis. Any two of these if similar, make disease difficult to treat  . Though treatment design is based on multiple variables, Prakriti has a role in selection of drug, dose, Anupaana (vehicle) and Samskaara (processing). Considering Prakriti (coupled with other factors) some drugs or procedures are indicated (Ghrita for Vaata and Pitta Prakriti ) or contraindicated (Svedana for PittaPrakriti ). Prakriti of an individual illustrates numerous physiological functions, as Agni (digestive and metabolic capacity), Kosht`ha (digestive and excretory functions), Bala (Strength of tissues) and life span are specific for each Prakriti. Systematic objective clinical evaluation is essential for understanding of Prakriti . Prakriti assessment with other factors of Das`havidha Parikshaa should be contemplated for total understanding of patient or healthy individual  .

Kalaa as per the scriptures from Sus`hruta is nothing but the limiting membrane / substance between the Dhaatu and Aas`haya. As per the Nirukti, Kalaa refers to certain structural as well as functional components, which afford support to the bodily structures and carry out the Dhaaran`a Karma [Vaachaspatyam]. Though the sixteenth portion according to Rasaratnasamuchchaya is called Kalaa. [Aayurvedeeya Shabdakosha] and Charaka has described Kalaa as minute parts [C.Su.12/1], from the S`haareera point of view, Kalaa is one of the different bodily structure, explained in Garbhavyaakaran`a S`haaeeira of Sus`hruta Samhitaa. Here, Sus`hruta has defined Kalaa as the limiting strucures between the Dhaatu and Aas`haya. [S. Sha. 4/5]. Kalaa is said to be the limiting structures / membranes between the Dhaatu and its Aas`haya. It must be noted here, that the term Dhaatu is not merely the seven Dhaatu_s but it is inclusive of all the Dosha-Dhaatu-Mala, which in their normal status perform Dhaaran`a Karma. Aas`haya has been defined as the cavity existing between the Dhaatu_s. It is actually a reservoir for a temporary purpose for particular substances. Against this background, Kalaa can be defined as the separating membranes or similar structures existing on a microscopic level between the Dhaatu_s and their Aas`haya_s. As the skins cover the body from outside, in the same way Kalaa, which is thin, minute in nature covers the Dhaatvaas`haya internally. Sus`hruta has described Kalaa elaborately. Obviously, there are references to Kalaa S`haareera in Asht`aanga Samgraha and Ashat`aanga Hridaya. Kalaa is formed during the embryonic life and then persists throughout life. The process of the development of Kalaa has been described as follows: If we take the transverse section through it then we are able to see these internal layers with the help of a microscope more clearly. In the same way, Kalaa is developed for e.g. the Kleda, which is present in between the S`hukra Dhaatu and S`hukraas`haya gets processed with S`hukrqagni and then S`hukradharaa Kalaa is formed. Kalaa structures are very minute in nature, which are placed deep inside body. Hence they are Apratyaksha i.e. invisible to the naked eye. According to D`alhan`a, these describing Kalaa, Sus`hruta has used Upamaana Praman`a. As already noted, Kalaa are formed just the internal layers of the bark of a tree. We are able to see this internal part only after removing the superficial parts. In the same way, as Kalaa are placed internally in between Dhaatu and its Aas`haya, it can be seen after removing the covering of Dhaatu. In the Uterus, as the embryo is covered completely by the placental membranes, as various parts are covered by Mucus, in the same way, Dhaatvaas`haya are internally covered by Kalaa. As the Kleda from which the Kalaa gets developed are devoid of Dhaatu Saara or contains very less amount of it, therefore they are not able to get transformed into the next Dhaatu. This is the reason, why Kalaa are not arranged sequentially as the Dhaatu-Utpatti. But their sequence is according to Vishavega. As a less amount of Saara-Bhaaga is present in Kalaa, so, they are termed as Kalaa. Seven Kalaa as described in the various Aayurvedic texts, are summarized in the following manner. (Note that there is no reference in the present Charaka Samhitaa regarding Kalaa at all). The following table shows a comparative statement about the references of Kalaa in Sus`hruta Samhitaa, Asht`aanga Samgraha, Bhaava Prakaas`ha and S`haarangdhara Samhitaa. It is observed from this table that S`haarangdhara has called the Raktadharaa Kalaa as Asrukdharaa Kalaa. Purishadharaa Kalaa has been called as Maladharaa and Antrashrayi by the Bhaava Prakaas`ha and S`haarangdhara respectively; while Pittdhara Kalaa has been called Agnidharaa Kalaa by S`haarangdhara and S`hukradharaa Kalaa as Retodharaa by both S`haarangdhara and Bhaava Prakaas`ha. There is reference to Yakrita-Pleehodhara by S`haarangdhara in place of Shleshmadharaa Kalaa. Table No. 01 Kalaa according to various Samhitaas: From the above-mentioned facts, it will be clear that, though there are even Dhaatu_s described, but not every Dhaatu possess its Kalaa. The sequencing of Dhaatu is according to their Poshan`a Karma (Nutritive aspect). But the Kalaa are described as per their Dhaaran`a Karma (i.e. maintaining aspect). This Dhaaran`a is on the structural as well as functional level. As far as Mamsadharaa Kalaa is concerned, it is supportive to all Dhaatu_s physically. Hence, it has been described first in the order of the entire Kalaa. If we take a look at their functions, then it becomes evident that they exist all over the body at the cellular level. So that, it can be said that Kalaa are present in most of the cases all over the body, or at least in its extensive portion. Kalaa are described according to the sequence of the spread of a toxin, once it is introduced in the body, as described in Kalpasthaana of Sus`hruta Samhitaa. When snake poison enters the body it gets transmitted from one Dhaatu to another. As already stated, Kalaa are present in between the related Dhaatu_s and its Aas`haya. Hence, while traveling from one Dhaatu to another, it gets transmitted to a specific Kalaa and show specific symptoms in the body. This is called Vishavega. Accordingly, seven Vishavega_s are produced. E.g. In the first Vega, poison goes from Rasa to Rakta through the Maamsadharaa Kalaa. D`alhan`a states here that Purishadharaa and Pittadharaa Kalaa are related to Asthidharaa and Majjaadharaa Kalaa respectively. When the poison crosses these, related symptoms are produced which are termed as fifth and sixth Vishavega. The transmission to some extent acts as a barrier between the Visha and Dhaatu thus preventing it from easy access throughout the whole body. Hence, in one-way Kalaa give certain type of protection from Visha. Moreover it is helpful in the diagnosis of a particular stage of poisoning which ultimately helps the cure. Srotas are certain body parts through which some production in the form of oozing of intermediary products of Metabolism (i.e. Dhaatuparin`amana) takes place. Charaka has explained that Srotaamsi are made up of Dhaatu_s and they have the color of the respective related Dhaatu. The main function of Srotas is the transport of unformed or intermediary Dhaatu, which along the way get transformed into a formed mature / Sthaayee Dhaatu. As we have seen that Kalaa are the separating membranes between the Dhaatu and its Aas`haya. Therefore Kalaa have an inevitable relationship with Srotaamsi. One is the separating structure of Dhaatu and the other is made up of Dhaatu and transmits it. At the cellular level their relationship can be explained. Kalaa are porous in nature. Through this porosity, there is transformation of Dhaatu, so that one side of Kalaa there is unformed / immature Dhaatu and on the other side is the formed / mature Dhaatu of the respective Srotas. Other underlying ideas regarding Kalaas`haareera: Kalaa must be regarded as an admixture of the structural and functional components at the root level of the bodily basic elements. It must also be agreed that not all Kalaa_s can be interpreted on the same principle as per Nirukti and definition of Kalaa. Dr. Mukund Erande Principal and H.O.D.

Kloma = Pittaas`haya = Gall bladder Kloma = Agnyaas`haya = Pancreas Kloma = Yakrit = Liver Kloma = Dakshin`a Phupphusa = Right Lung Any organ according to the Samhitaa should fulfill the following criteria to be labeled as Kloma.

U.41/21 A person who has walked in sun for a certain period of time and is now suffering from Adhva S`hosha exhibits a laxity of the musculature, lethargy, a roasted tanned dry complexion, an impaired tactile perception and a dry Kloma, pharynx and mouth. Kloma is an organ which is connected to Yakrit inferiorly and the Hridaya and it is situated in the chest. It should surround the heart from all sides, without being attached to it and be mainly on the right side of the chest cavity. This is the gist of the above discussion. Now if we try and fit one of the previously enumerated hypotheses, each one of them falls short on one or more important aspects. We therefore need to view the issue from a fresh angle in an objective manner. In modern Anatomy, we find an organ described which fulfills most of the criteria admirably and can safely be termed as Kloma. It is the Mediastinum. These and many more examples, in the same vein, indicate the control of the fluid balance of the body. Kloma is one of the fifteen Kosht`haanga described and derives its origin from the mother.

Yakrita Hridaya Paars`hvam Cha Kloma Vakshasthitam Viduh / (Hastyaayurvedah  Sha. 7/11) Now we shall briefly consider some abnormalities based on the foregoing hypothesis. Trit` - Thirst is the main indicator of the malfunctioning Udakavaha Srotas of which Kloma is one of the origins. A progressive fluid loss as a result of exercise, hyper ventilation, vomit or purging results in loss of fluidity of the circulating Rasa, Udaka and Rakta - the fluid Dhaatu of the body. The Hridaya (heart) has to exert more to pump the dense fluid and natural urge drink water is produced. As a result of overworking of the Hridaya the fluid in its covering is also depleted and the Hridaya has to work against resistance offered by the all encompassing, oppressive sac which has turned its foe due to fluid density. This results in a feeling of dryness of the mouth first, throat later, and much later in a considerable thirst which is not quenched easily. It is the common experience of a cool sip which induces a sense of well being. A diagonally opposite thirst appears as a result of heavy food (Guru Anna), a heavy substance causes the Aahaara Parin`aamakara Bhaava upset requiring more Kaala (time), Kleda (fluids), Ushn`a (heat) it would otherwise need. The time can be adjusted by observing fast, but the Kleda or fluid has to be supplemented from outside - in order to render it fluid and absorbable - the cold water taken aggravates the thirst as it helps to put out or douse the Ushn`a which in its first place is unable to convert it. Thus the guru Rasa which is absorbed from the Mahaasrotas reaches the heart and again it has to work against the resistance of the heavy Rasa and the excess fluid state of the Udaka Rasavaha Srotas. The problem could be easily tackled by taking sips of hot water which due to its heat would penetrate the heavy food material and render it more subtle. It is observed at the end of some time, even the residue is dealt with effectively, without causing clogging, water logging and thirst which is aggravated by cold water. Kloma-Aakarshan`a - Charaka describes the grave disorder arising out of the cardiac involvement which results in, ultimately collapse of a lung either by external trauma or internal Doshika activity. The median Kloma is critically balanced by the positive pressures exerted by the lungs on it from either side. The space of the Kloma offers passage to various fluids like Rasa, Rakta, Udaka to and from the heart along with the incessant rhythmic activity of the heart in its pericardium. Should a lung collapse as a result of either trauma in an acute manner, the balance displaces the mediastinum along with its contents, e.g.. Esophagus, trachea, bronchi, and may even cause kinks in the great vessels. If the lung is not inflated and the balance restored, the life of the person could be in jeopardy. In more chronic cases like Jaraa S`hosha and Jalaja Paars`hvas`hoola the affected lung may succumb slowly causing gradual impairment in the form of lost or impaired elasticity and hampering the function of mediastinal organs. An affliction of the heart by vitiated Dosha thus affects the Kloma adversely and causes amongst others, a mediastinal shift which can be fatal. The Kloma is an organ, due to its anatomical position and its contents which are the esophagus, trachea, heart and vessels. The circulating fluid volume of the body passes through it at one time or the other during the cyclic movement either in the form of Rasa, Rakta (Blood) or Udaka (Lymph) and Anna (Bolus). Therefore, any abnormality of these channels results in subsequent impairment, either functional or structural of the Kloma, or conversely, an acute or chronic functional or structural impairment of the Kloma subsequently results in the impaired functioning of either Rasavaha, Praan`avaha, Raktavaha, Udakavaha and Annavaha Srotas. Abstract The author discusses in this paper presents the much debated and controversial organ of Kloma in an objective manner and establishes its relevancy by interpreting various classical texts.

Agnikarma can be performed in various patterns, including linear, circular, and crescent-shaped. The depth and duration of the burn determine the severity of the effects, which can range from mild skin irritation to deep tissue damage. After Agnikarma, the body experiences an increase in heat and inflammation, which can lead to pain, fever, and other symptoms.

S.Su. 12-2 (D`alhan`a) * Its superiority and importance S.Su. 12-3 Types of Dahanopakaran`aani and their exact action on the tissues of body: They could be classified as Vanaspatija  Pippalee, (Pipper Longum) Yasht`imadhu (Glycerrhiza Glabra Linn.) Haridraa (Curcuma longa), Gud`a,( jaggery) Sneha  Taila, Sarjarasa (herbal) Praan`ija  Ajas`hakrita, Godanta, Madhoochchhisht`a (animal-origin) Metallic and others  Panchadhaatu (Gold, Silver, Copper, Iron and Brass) S`hara Shalaaka, Jambavausht`ha, Sooryakaanta, Soochi, Stone For  1. Tvakgata Vaata Vikaara: Pippalee, Ajas`hakrita, Godanta, S`hara S`halaakaa 2. Maamsagata Vikaara  Jambavausht`ha, Panchadhaatu S`halaakaa Kshaudra 3. Siraa, Snaayu, Sandhi, Marma, Madhu (Kshaudra), Gud`a (Jaggery), Sneha. S.Su.12-4 * Contraindications: Sites  Siraa, Snaayu, Sandhi, Asthi and Marma If there is bleeding from Siraa, Agnikarma should be undertaken as the last measure to control bleeding. It is one of the popular methods for controlling bleeding. As Agnikarma performed on Maamsa also acts on Siraa, Snaayu, Asthi, Sandhi, no separate Agnikarma need be performed Marmasthaana is the absolute contraindication for Agnikarma. S.Su.12-4 (D`alhan`a) * Kaala (Time) for Agnikarma: Greeshma Ritu and S`harad Ritu are unsuitable for Agnikarma. In an acute condition, Agnikarma should be done by taking precautions against likely Pittaprakopa after Agnikarma. S.Su.12-5 * Poorvakarma:  It should only be done by giving Pichchhila Anna except in Agnikarma for As`hmaree, Mootravaahi Naad`ivran`a, Bhagandara, Ars`ha, and Mukharoga (where food should not be given.) S.Su.12-6 In the Vartma Roga, it should be done by protecting the eye with water soaked cotton pad but keeping the eyelids open for Vartmadahana. S.Su.12-9 * Diseases and conditions where Agnikarma should be carried out: S`hiroroga, Adhimantha, at Bhroo  Lalaat`a  S`hamkha Prades`ha. S.Su.12-9 Hard, Non-painful / painful, over granulated wounds, situated at Tvachaa, Siraa, Snaayu, Sandhi, Asthi Ars`ha, Arbuda, Bhagandara, Apachi, S`hleepada, Charmakeela, Tilakaalaka, Antarvidradhi, Amputed / cut Siraa and Sandhi, Naad`ivran`a, and bleeding from blood vessels. S.Su.12-9 and 12-10. * Unfit Patients for Agnikarma: - Pitta Prakriti, Haematoma in wounds, burst abdomen with damage to Kosht`haanga_s (like liver, stomach, bladder etc.), wound with suspected foreign body, debilitated patients, children, older people, and timid individuals. Those having Paan`d`u, Madhumeha, Raktapitta, (Bleeding tendency  Hemophiliacs), Asvedya etc. are contraindicated for Agnikarma. S.Su.12-14 * Dahana Prakaara: Vilekhaa  [linear fashion], Bindu [dot], Valaya [circular], Pratisaaran`a / space for figure [scratching], Ardhachandra [half moon shaped], Ardhachandraardha [ 1/4 th moon shaped], Svastika, Asht`apaada [ star with eight appendages] S.Su.12 11. and A.H.Su.30.8 * According to depth or due to Pramaada [fault] of Vaidya, Dagdha is also classified as: Tvak Dagdha and Maamsa Dagdha  It is not that Dagdha on Siraa, Snaayu, Sandhi and Asthi is absolutely contraindicated. S.Su.12-7 and (D`alhan`a.) Pramaada Dagdha  this is also known as Dagdha. It is sub classified as  Plusht`a Dagdha, Durdagdha, Asamyak Dagdha, and Atidagdha. It is accidental. S.Su.12- 7 According to the material, which has caused the Dagdha  i. Hot Snehadagdha  vegetable oil, or ghee, or wax, ii. Rooksha Dagdha  hot hard substances, hot stone, bark of tree, hot bamboo, Panchadhaatu etc. Sneha Dagdha always produces more pain as hot Sneha penetrates the skin and other tissues by entering through Siraa. S.Su.12-15 * Signs and symptoms of different types of Dagdha: Tvak Dagdha: A typical noise Choorra, a foul smell, and contraction of skin. Maamsa Dagdha: Skin becomes Kapota Varn`a (blue green), with a little Oedema and pain, Vran`a becomes dry and narrowed Siraasnaayu Dagdha: The Dagdha Vran`a gets elevated and becomes black and Vran`a becomes dry as the Sraava (Discharge is obstructed) Sandhyaasthi Dagdha: Vran`a becomes non-glossy (lusterless), becomes copper red, and Asthi becomes non-shining Siraa Dagdha: discharge of Serum. S.Su.12-8. * Selection of Dagdha Dravya for Dagdha and its Criteria: After taking into consideration the season and place where the Agnikarma is to be carried out, severity and condition of the disease, patients strength, and avoiding the Marmasthaana, Agnikarma of selected types like Bindu, Valaya, Rekhaa and determining Dhaatu  Tvachaa, Maamsa etc. Dagdha should be done. S.Su.12-12. * Effects of Aganikarma on the body: Immediately after Dahana, Rakta and Pitta are vitiated chronologically. Agni and Pitta are of Ushn`a Veerya and their Rasa is Kat`u. Dagdha increases the intensity immediately, and depending on the site and size of Dagdha, burning pain, Jvara (pyrexia) and signs and symptoms of Marmaaghaata develop. At the site of Dagdha, there is formation of blister on the skin, and Maamsa and Snaayu get separated. This occurs either immediately or slowly. This variation will depend on the size and depth of the burn and the region of the body, e.g. mouth, chest and the area of burn S.Su. 12-17-18. * Signs and Symptoms of Dagdha related to temperature and depth of Dagdha: Plusht`a Dagdha  Change in the color of the skin, which becomes a little red. There is no formation of a blister but there is intense burning. Treatment: Give a little fomentation. Due to Dagdha, there is coagulation of blood at the site of the burn, which obstructs the flow of Vaayu (Vaayu becomes Aavritta). This results in stagnation of heat at the site of the burn. Fomentation (hot) helps to liquefy the clotted blood warmth results in vasodilatation, which opens the channels which release Vaayu ultimately, resulting in reduction of swelling and the burning pain. If we give cold fomentation there is more Skandana (coagulation) of blood creating more and more obstructive pathology resulting in more Oedema, burning and pain. This treatment is called Virudhaarthkaarin`ee Chikitsaa. S.Su.12-16 and A.H.Su. 30- 47. and S.Su.12-20, 21 22 and Chakrapaan`i Durdagdha: There is formation of a blister with burning and dragging (Chosha) sensation, inflamed Oedema, redness and pain. These symptoms disappear in short time. Treatment: It depends upon depth. If it is deep, give a cold fomentation to allow the heated blood to go out. Here, cold acts as an antagonist. If the burn is superficial give a hot fomentation to allow the blood to liquefy. Other treatment: Application of Ghrita, Lepa and Avasechana. Some says that if there is severe burning, a cold fomentation should be given and if the burning sensation is less, give a hot fomentation. S.Su.12-22 and (D`alhan`a) Samyak Dagdha: In Samyak Dagdha, the Dagdha is superficial. The color of the area is bluish green (Kapota Varn`a) and has other signs of Tvak and Maamsa Dagdha. In Samyak Dagdha, to alleviate and pacify the vitiated Rakta, Pitta and pain, bathe the wound with honey and ghee or Yasht`imadhu Ghrita. Give Lepa of Tugaaskheeri, Plaksha, Fucus Lacor, Chandana, Santalum, Gud`oochee (Tinospora Cardifolia) & ghee. Apply Graamyaanoopaudaka Maamsa. Give the treatment of Pitta Vidradhi. S.Su.12-13 and 23-24. Atidagdha: Sign and Symptoms: It results in loss of limb, excessive damage to Maamsa and Snaayu, complications in relation to Siraa, Snaayu, Sandhi, Asthi, and fever (temperature) burning pain, thirst and in extreme cases unconsciousness. The wound takes a long time to heal and never acquires the normal color and texture. Treatment: If there are signs and symptoms of Marmaaghaata priority should be given to it Dead muscles and tissues should be removed (Debridement) Give Lepa of the pulp of rice ground in ghee. Put leaf of Kamalapatra Ne Lumbo Nucifera or Gud`oochee Patra on it. S.Su.12-16 and 25 26 * Treatment of Snehadagha and Rooksha Dagdha: In Sneha Dagdha, give Rooksha treatment In Rooksha Dagdha give Snehana treatment S.Su.12-29 * Treatment of Burns due to other causes: Due to hot air  All S`heetopachaara Due to ice or frost. Snigdha and Ushn`opachaara Due to lightning bombs, electricity  usually results in death but if survives symptomatic treatment according to Marmaaghaata and Snehana, Abhyanga, Parisheka according to the type of burn. S.Su.12- 38 39, Universal Ointment: Ropan`a Ghrita for any type of burn Bee Wax, Madhuka, Symplocos Raci  Shorea Robusta Rubia Cordifolia, Chandana and Murvasiddha Clematosi Triloba Gouriana Ghrita S.Su.12- 27, 28. Signs and Symptoms: This condition is produced due to inhalation of smoke produced by burning material  like, stems and wood of trees, coal gas, in a closed room. Thirst [Trishn`aa], Daaha, Jvara, Tandraa, Glaani, slow respiration and pulse etc. as it enters the lungs during respiration it produces dyspnoea, sneezing, cough, smell of smoke to exhaled air. He has a perception of the smell of smoke. Only by the sense of taste he recognizes salt and hot [Lavan`a and Kat`u]. He is unable to hear anything. If smoke enters in the Gastro  intestinal tract, there is distention of abdomen. If he cannot get fresh air, it results in cyanosis, slow respirations and pulse, stupor, unconsciousness and finally death. S.Su.12-2937 Treatment: Bring the patient into the open air and if possible, give Praan`avaayu. Give treatment of slow respiration like Hemagarbha Give emetics like Ghrita, Ikshurasa Sacchrum Munja, Draakshaarasa, Vitis Vinifera, milk, S`harkaraa Jala, and Madhuraamla Rasa. A good vomit stops Body ache regulates temperature, burning sensation giddiness, Trishan`aa, Aadhamaana, cough and Dyspnoea. Give Kavala  of Madhura, Lavan`a, Tikta and Amla Rasa. Give S`hirovirechana Nasya. When toxic symptoms disappear, give a soft easily digestible (Laghu) and Snigdha Aahaara. S.Su.12- 36-37 Dr. R. B. Gogte Ex - Professor and H.O.D.

Types of Arbuda Vaataja Pittaja Kaphaja Raktaja Maamsaja Medoja Saamaanya Sampraapti: Dosha gets accumulated (Sammoorchchhita) vitiating Maamsa. These Dosha get manifested as circular, stable, paining mildly, large sized oedema (S`hopha). The root of the oedema is big (Analpamoola). There is growth of Maamsa (Maamsopachaya). This S`hopha is called as Arbuda. Symptoms of Vaataja, Pittaja, Kaphaja and Medoja Arbuda are same as those of Granthi. Raktaarbuda: Sampraapti and signs Vitiated Dosha entered into Rakta. These Dosha press the Siraa causing elevation of muscular growth without Paaka. It is overspread with Maamsaamkura (muscular elevations). There is continuous oozing of blood. This type of Arbuda is Asaadhya. Then it leads to the complications of Raktakshaya which further develops Paan`d`u. Maamsaarbuda: Sampraapti and signs Any trauma over the muscle, due to vitiation of Maamsa develops S`hopha without pain discolouration and movement. It is Snigdha and does not suppurate.

They obstruct the urinary tract and cause pain and discomfort.\n\n**Symptoms of Urinary Stones**\n\nThe symptoms of urinary stones vary depending on their type and location. Common symptoms include:\n\n* Pain and discomfort in the urinary tract\n* Difficulty or frequent urination\n* Blood in the urine\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Fatigue and weakness\n\n**Treatment of Urinary Stones**\n\nAyurveda recommends a holistic approach to treating urinary stones, which involves:\n\n* Dietary modifications to balance the doshas\n* Herbal remedies to dissolve and expel stones\n* Lifestyle changes to prevent recurrence\n\n**Prognosis**\n\nThe prognosis for urinary stones depends on their type, size, and duration.

Sus`hruta has mentioned Kapha dominance in all the types of the As`hmaree as Kapha itself is converted into As`hmaree. Nirukti: Tulyataam As`hmanaa Yaanti Tasmaat Taam As`hamri Viduh | Sampraapti: In a person who consumes unwholesome diet, aggravated Kapha saturates the urine causing As`hmaree. Urine is dried along with the S`hukra, Pitta, Vaayu or Kapha, causing As`hmaree like the drying of the Pitta in the cow forming Gorochana. Dosha get saturated with the Mootra causing As`hmaree according to Upasnehana Nyaaya. Types: Vaataja Pittaja Kaphaja S`hukraja As`hmaree resembles Kadamba Pushpa. It is S`hlakshn`a. It may be tri-folded and soft. When it obstructs the path of urine, it causes pain in the Basti. There is pain in Sevanee, Mehana, Basti. Urination gets distorted. There is pain in the Med`hra (Mridgaati Med`hram). Also the person passes urine frequently. Due to irritation if there is wound in the urinary tract, then there is heamaturia. When the As`hmaree gets broken, the gravel passes through the urine. This is Mootra S`harkaraa. Vaataja As`hmaree Aggravated Kapha enters into the Basti Mukha causing its obstruction. Signs and Symptoms: Daalana, Bhedana, Toda. Basti becomes heavy and cold. As`hmaree is S`hyaava, Rooksha in colour, having sharp edges. Pittaja As`hmaree Pitta along with the Kapha get saturated and enter into the Basti Mukha causing obstruction. Signs and Symptoms: Chosha, Daaha, Paaka. Basti resembles the Ushn`a Vaata. As`hmaree resemble the Bhallaatakaasthi. It is Red or yellow or black. Kaphaja As`hmaree Kapha along with the Vaayu get saturated causing obstruction by residing into the Basti Mukha. Signs and Symptoms: Vedanaa, As`hmaree is large in size, S`hlakshn`a in appearance. It is white in colour. All these three types of As`hmaree are seen in the children. In the older person S`hukraja type is seen. S`hukraja As`hmaree Due to Maithuna Vighaata or AtiMaithuna, S`hukra does not get ejaculated properly and gets saturated along with the Vaayu. It gets situated into the joining of Med`hra and Vrishan`a. After residing there it gets dried there. It obstructs the urinary tract. Signs and Symptoms: Mootra Krichchhra, Basti Vedanaa, Vrishan`a S`hotha. If As`hmaree is newly formed, then after Peed`ana it gets dissolved, but if it old, it does not get dissolved. When As`hmaree enters into the urinary tract, it causes Daurbalya, Sadana, Kaars`hya, Kukshi S`hoola, Arochaka, Paan`d`utva, Ush`naVaata, Trishn`aa, Hritpeed`ana, Chhardi .

In the condition, Asthi Bhagna (fracture) or Asthi Chyuta (dislocation), the bones should be placed in the original anatomical position properly (Reduction of the fracture). With the cotton pads (Kavalikaa) and the Kus`hikaa, using abundant Ghee (Ghrita); the bones should be placed properly and stabilized so that the reduced bone ends do not undergo displacement and result in non or mal union. Lepana: (ointment or plaster) is carried on the fractured site. Lepana Should be prepared using Manjisht`haa, Madhuka, Raktachandana with S`hatadhauta Ghrita. Bandhana: In the cold season, the bandage or plaster should be changed after every 7 days. In temperate climate (Saadhaaran`a), the bandage or plaster should be changed after every 5 days. In the hot season, the bandage or plaster should be changed after every 3 days. Or in general, the plaster can be changed by looking at the condition of Dosha at the fractured site. Bandha should not be loose or too tight. In either case, the bones can not be stabilized properly. There may be S`hopha (oedema), Ruk (pain), Paaka (suppuration) at the site of fracture.

It means that the process of delivery is obstructed: Any manual thing done by a Vaidyas hand is to be treated as a surgical procedure rightly described as S. Su. 7/3 When a normal procedure of delivery fails usually the patient requires surgical interference. The first surgical procedure without damaging the baby in a live or dead condition is manipulation of the presenting part by the Vaidya. This may be called as internal version. If the procedure fails then the second surgical procedure starts. Special note: Under no condition should the dead baby be kept in the mothers womb for a longer time as it endangers the life of the mother. Inspite of our efforts to save the life of a mother during the process of labour, if she dies and if the baby is alive, without spending any time, a lower abdominal incision should be taken and the baby should be taken out. There is one controversial statement that appears in Triskandha that the incision should be taken at the outlet of the Garbhamaarga. The other postoperative treatment in case of the mother will be that of Prasoota. In case of Retained Placenta, if the medicinal treatment like application of Aparmara, Kalalaavi or Dhoopana (smoke exposure) of vaginal area, by out casted skin of black (Krishn`a) serpent, mechanical devices like putting the hair in the mouth, fails then bimanual pressure should be given to the uterus to expel the retained placenta. If it fails it should be removed manually by the Vaidyas hand. There are no references to placenta acreta in Ayurvedic sciences. Surgical treatment for Danta-Naad`ee A sinus through tooth/gum/mandible / skin is usually the result carious teeth, needing removal of tooth with proper debridement and cauterizing the spot. Usually the Danta-Naad`ee develops as a sequel to Krimidanta or Danta-Pupput`a Vidradhi. Developed sinus drains from root of the tooth to skin over the mandible with a constant discharge of pus, serosanguinious nature the treatment consists of removal of a tooth with Lekhana and Agnikarma Chikitsaa on the sinus. If the bone is damaged (Asthividradhi) then scrapping of the bone should also be done. The second condition is always difficult to give absolute health care management.  This condition is many a times Sahaaj or sometime acquired due to adhesions of the prepusal skin to (Med`hraman`i) glans. The commonest diseases that are cause for it are  Phiranga, Upadansita and repeated UTI. Other causes are unhygienic ways of keeping the prepusal skin in clean condition. Here there is narrowing of external urinary passage (Mootra Maarga) especially with regard to the level of the skin. Surgical treatment consists of dilation of the small opening by S`halaakaa, of upper diameters. If this fails the prepusal skin is excised by keeping the forceps at 12, 6, 3 and g position. This is a type of operation, circumcision , that is described in modern surgery. Such a type of condition is not prevalent in the Muslim community as the excessive skin over Med`hraman`i is excised in their infancy. This is the exact way of keeping the prepusal skin clean where there is excessive water shortage.  This condition is usually caused by a trauma of horn of different animals over the abdomen. This results in two different conditions Surgical Treatment: The Medovarti is to be washed thoroughly with water if it is much damaged. The damaged part should first be tied with a thread at the healthy portion and the remaining damaged Medovarti (omentum) should be excised by a hot knife. Excision by hot knife controls the bleeding and also prevents infection. The remaining healthy part should be bathed with ghee and then placed in the abdomen. The abdomen is then sutured.  Surgical Treatment:  This is again a type of bhinnavrana caused by trauma to the scrotal wall. One or both Mushkagranthi protrude through the wound. Surgical Treatment: If undamaged, the testicles should be replaced in the Mushka-Kosha and the wound is sutured. A T-shaped bandage or Utsangi Bandha should be used till the wound heals totally. Note: In all these conditions sutures should be removed after 7 days. The post-operative treatment for Sadyovran`a is to be given for 7 days. In case of Vran`a Dusht`i, the appropriate treatment should be given as post-operative care. Medicinal smoke by burning particular material  Dhoopan Chikitsaa should be given twice a day for 10 days to the wound of the patient along with his clothings and his rooms. Galgan`d`a: Surgical treatment is only indicated in medoja galgand (nodular goitre) The treatment consists of Parasurgical treatment consists of Viddha Chikitsaa in the inguinal region  Note: Galgan`d`a has no tendency to undergo suppuration but sometimes especially after a longtime, the Pittaja Galagan`d`a, may develop inflammation. All measures to control the infection should be taken. It results in ulcer formation, and should be treated as Oordhava- Jatrugata-Vran`a  If after a trauma the eyeball comes out with its attachment intact, then it should be replaced in orbital cavity by application of suitable fat and lotus leaf (Sneha and Kamalapatra). The rest of treatment is to be given of Bhinnavran`a with a special precaution that Pitta-Dosha should not be vitiated.  Galas`hun`d`ee: Sometimes there is enlargement of Galas`hun`d`ee either due to Galas`hun`d`ee Paaka or Ati-Maamsaas`hana. Inflammatory Galas`hun`d`ee should be treated medically. Other types are treated surgically. The enlarged Galas`hun`d`ee is divided into three parts. A ligature is kept at the level of upper 2/3 and lower 1/3. After putting ligature lower 1/3 is cut off (Chhedana)  No Gilaayu S`hastrakarma has been described in the Sus`htruta Samhitaa  After doing placing back of prolapsed portion (Asthaapana) of Gudabhrams`ha, a special type of bandage called Charmabandha having a hole for passing flatus and faeces is used. Now this Bandha is of Gophan`aa or Utsangi type. The treatment is to be continued till the patient gets relief. While doing Asthaapana of Bhrams`ha, use of Chukra Taila or Mooshaka Siddha Taila is useful. Surgical treatment for Kadara (corn): Surgical treatment for Kadara consists of Udakodara: This is one phase (Avasthaa) of Yakrut Daalyodara. There is Sthanasams`hraya of Dosha in the abdominal cavity. As far as possible surgical treatment of removal of water is to be avoided but if the medical treatment fails, if the patient gets difficulty in respiration, if he develops severe edema; or if it is likely to develop ulceration, then Viddha Chikitsaa for removal of fluid is urgently indicated. The patient is made upright in a sitting position with an abdominal binder over the upper abdomen. Snehana and Svedana are done over the lower abdomen, on the left side 4 fingers below and 4 fingers away from umbilicus. A trocar and canula is inserted in the abdominal cavity, the trocar is removed and the canula is kept in site till requisite amount is removed (tap). After removal of fluid, a tight abdominal bandage is to be given to prevent Vaata-Prakopa (due to the pressure of the abdominal fluid on abdominal vessels, they are more or less in a compressed condition. As soon as the fluid is removed they get relaxed and there is more pouring of blood in the vessels. It can sometimes result in hemorrhage)  Wrong localization of intestines or fluids makes appearance as if the part is enlarged (more) in size. This is termed Vriddhi. The surgical treatment varies according to the type of Vriddhi  Procedure: Mootravriddhi: In Mootravriddhi, Viddha Chikitsaa has been advised. Now this Viddha is to be done on the lateral side of Sivani on the side where Mootravriddhi is to be located after doing Snehana and Svedana locally. All the fluid is tapped by using trocar and canula. After removal of fluid a tight bandage is applied to prevent Vaata-Prakopa (Please refer to pathology under heading Udakodara)  After doing Snehana and Svedana a bilateral incision is to be taken lateral to the Sivani (Rufae). The whole Meda is removed and cavity is dressed by Harataala and Manhs`hilaa. Harataala and Manhs`hilaa are to be used till the wound heals.  Raktaja and Pittaja Vriddhi: Treatment is nothing but incision and drainage if it undergoes suppression. Post  operative treatment consists of all Pittaghna Vran`a-Upachaara both externally and internally.  Kaphaja and Vaataja Vriddhi: These are to be treated medically still if they undergo suppressive changes treatment of Baahya Vidradhi is to be given.  Bhagandara: In a surgical treatment more consideration is given to the type of Naad`eevran`a namely Chandraardha, Chandra-Chakra and Sarvatobhadra instead of taking into consideration the type of Dosha. The two types of Naad`eevran`a are not to be described in the main: Gotirthaka  where Naad`eevran`a is of zigzag nature Kharjurupatraka  where there is one single main nadi with multiple branching. This variety we get in S`hataponaka Bhagandara. These two varieties are to be derived from the types of incisions that have been described earlier.  Treatment: The treatment mainly consists of excision of whole fistulas tract. Before doing procedure of excision Eshan`akarma is to be done to confirm the type of Bhagandara. Types of excisions for this type of fistulas are namely as follows: - Laangalaka  Plough - Aardhalaangalaka  half plough - Sarvatobhadra -Gotirtha -Kharjurpatra Now these Bhagandara_s are of two types - Avachina - Paraachina In case of Paraachina Bhagandara (blind internal) usually Ksharkarma and Agnikarma are indicated. In case of Antar Bahirmukha. Bhagandara, usually the Kshaarsootra is indicated. Kshaarkarma and Agnikarma could be done in any type of Bhagandara where Kapha and Vaata predominates. All the Chheda_s and Naad`eevran`a_s are illustrated elsewhere.  As`hmaree: In case of As`hmaree , Ayurveda takes it as a neat a fatal operation. But by keeping the As`hmaree as it is, it also may take the life of the patient. So to do a surgery on bladder located Bastistha As`hmaree is like taking a chance to save the life of a patient. The patient is given lithotomy position and a para-periurethral incision is taken on the left or right perineal region by keeping one finger in the rectum. By putting the other hand over the lower abdomen the stone is brought down in such a way, so as to it could be fixed by the finger in the rectum. Now the incisions taken over the bladder, which is divided of the peritoneal line and the whole stone is removed by As`hmaree Nirharan`a Swastica Yantra. The bladder should not be opened at two places as it results in death of the person. As Savarn`a Prades`ha of Basti is damaged (resulting into contamination of the abdomen by the extravasated urine which is the cause for death and thats why it is described as Sadyopraan`ahara Marma. This death time may occur immediately or in 15 days. While taking the incision over the bladder one is to take care in not injuring the rectum, uterus in case of a female which is exactly behind it and S`hukravaha Dhamanyaa and Baahya Mootramaarga). After removal of the stone bladder it should be irrigated well. The stone should be removed completely without leaving behind any particle, which may again form the As`hmaree. After removal of the As`hmaree, there remains a Vran`a, which drains the urine called Mootravaahi Naad`ee Vran`a. Normally it heals naturally in 7 days. If it does not, Agnikarma should be done  These are the varieties of Udara Roga. Charaka has rightly said that these two conditions should only be treated by Dhanvantari i.e. a surgeon. Sus`hruta advises a left lateral lower paramedian incision (Four Angula_s below and lateral to umbilicus) now this incision was the correct incision, which facilitates when anaesthesia was not available. According to modern science also the intestines in the left iliac fossa are very free to move and secondly there is no posterior rectur sheath four finger below umbilicus. This was the easiest place to enter the abdominal cavity in a single stab incision.  After opening the abdominal cavity look for the site of perforation if any evidence of foreign body there to remove it and suture the intestinal wound by applying the black ants [Pipilikaa S`hirograsta]. As soon as they take the bite, keep the head as it is and remove the body. This is the first kind of non-absorbable suturing material that has been used for the first time in Ayurveda in the history of surgery. Close the wound, as in Baddhodara.

It is bulged like an inflated bladder. When it is ruptured, there is secretion of clear blood. There are different pains like Aayamana, Vyathaa, Toda, Pratyasyana (Kshepan`a), Krntana (Chhedana). At the last it bursts out (Bheda). It moves from one site to another. It gets enlarged or decreased suddenly. Pittaja Granthi It is yellowish red coloured. It gets it gets suppurated quickly also ruptured due to Pitta secreting hot blood (Ushn`a Asra). There is pain like Dahana, Dhoopana, Choshan`a, Pachana, Prajvalana. Kaphaja Granthi This Granthi gets enlarged after longer time. When it gets ruptured, there is secretion of white and thick pus (S`hukla Ghaana Pooya Sraava). It is cold to touch. There is no discolouration. There is mild pain. There is severe itching (AtiKan`d`oo). It is hard like stone. Medoja Granthi These Granthi gets aggravated or decreases as per the nourishment of the body. It is unctuous (Snigdha). It is big in size. There is mild pain. There is severe itching (Kan`d`oo). When it gets ruptured, it secretes like Pin`yaaka (Tila Kalka  oil cake) and Sarpi. Vaayu takes the Medas in to the Maamsa or Tvak manifesting with Granthi. This Granthi is Bhris`ha Snighda, it is soft (Mridu). It is Chala. It manifests with the symptoms of Kapha. It increases or decreases with the nourishment of the body. When it gets ruptured, it secretes Taamra and Asita (copper and black coloured) secretions. Siraaja Granthi Due to exercises performed by weak person, vitiated Vaayu causes Aakshepan`a (drawing together) of Siraa Prataana (branching of Sira). This Siraa Prataana is pressed (Sampeed`ana), constricted (Samkocha), dried out (Vis`hoshan`a), causing circular elevation which is called as Siraaja Granthi. It is Krichchhrasaadhya with pain and is mobile (Saruja and Chala). It is Asaadhya, it is stable (not movable), it is big in size. It is manifested on the site of Marma. Raktaja Granthi When Rakta Dhaatu gets vitiated due to Dosha, there is formation of Granthi. There is manifestation of Krimi. These Krimi gets harbored on the Siraa and Maamsa. There is Svaapa (numbness). It manifests with the Pitta Lakshan`a. Maamsaja Granthi It manifests with the symptoms of Kapha. It is caused due to vitiation of Maamsa. It is Snigdha, Kat`hina. There is Siraanaddhatva (inflated condition of Siraa). Asthi Granthi Due to trauma on the Asthi or due to fracture, there is elevation or depression of the Asthi; which is called as Asthi Granthi. Vran`a Granthi:- When a wound is not healed or in a healed wound, which is wet and not bandaged, or when there is trauma; Vaayu dries out the Rakta which is not secreted causes Grathita Vran`a (dense wound). There is Daaha, Kan`d`oo also. It is Vran`a Granthi. Sampraapti of Granthi It occurs in the particular part of the body because of vitiated Dosha. The signs and symptoms are manifested according to the dominance of Dosha. There are pulsations (Sphuran`a) as it is associated with vessels (Siraa). Granthi is a muscle tissue in large size (Mahaa Maamsa). It is painless. It Granthi is formed of Meda then it is unctuous and movable. Dosha vitiates Maamsa, Rakta and Medas. There is association of Kapha in vitiation of Medas. They cause circular, elevated protuberance (oedema) i.e. S`hopha which is extremely hard (Vigrathita  D`alhan`a); which is called as Granthi. Kapha dominant Dosha vitiating Maamsa, Medas and Rakta cause circular (Vritta), elevated (Unnata) oedema (S`hvayathu); which is called as Granthi as there is clogging (Grathanaat) of the Dosha and Dooshya. Granthi and Arbuda: Differential diagnosis Granthi and Arbuda are common in following aspects Prades`ha (manifesting site on the body) Hetu (Causative factors) Aakriti (form or shape) Dosha (Responsible Dosha) Dooshya (Involving Dhaatu) Granthi can have Paaka, while Arbuda do not get suppurate also they could be differentiated by other factors like touch, signs and history etc. Therefore, diagnosis of Granthi and Arbuda should be done considering above factors.

Types: Vaataja Pittaja Kaphaja Saannipaataja There are 28 types of Karn`a Roga in S`haalaakya Tantra. According to Chakrapaan`i, all the types explained in the S`haalaakya Tantra are ultimately fall under above said 4 types; therefore Charaka has mentioned only 4 types of Karn`a Roga. Comparative study of Karn`a Roga types: Karn`a S`hoola: Vaayu which is Vimaargaga (Anyathaa Chara), causes S`hoola (pain) around ear. This pain can be caused by the Aavrita Vaayu by other Dosha like Kaphaavrita Vaayu, Pittaavrita Vaayu and Raktaavrita Vaayu. This is difficult to treat. It is Krichchhrasaadhya.  Karn`a Naada / Pran`aada: Vimaargaga Vaayu (Vaayu traversing through the channels other than its normal way), when harbours in the S`habdavaahee Naad`ee, it causes different types of sounds, which is called as Karn`a Pran`aada. Baadhirya: When a condition where Vimaargaga Vaayu, harbour in to the S`habdavaha Siraa which is associated with Kapha; remains untreated then this manifests with the disease called as Baadhirya. This manifests with the Uchchhaih S`hruti (persons hear large sound). Karn`a Kshved`a: In a person to whom S`hodhana Nasya is given and who is consuming cold stuffs; due to physical strain, depletion of Dhaatu (Kshaya), consumption of Rooksha and Kashaaya (dry and astringent) diet, Vaayu resides in the S`habdavaha Srotas causing Karn`a Kshved`a. As per Maadhava Nidaana, Vaayu associated with Pitta etc. causes sound like Ven`u Ghosha, which is Karn`a Kshved`a. Karn`a Sraava (Samsraava): Due to trauma on the head, sinking in to the water, suppuration of Vidradhi, there is secretion of Pooya which is called as Karn`a Samsraava. Karn`a Kan`d`oo: In Karn`a Srotas, due to accumulation of Kapha (Kapha Prachita), there is manifestation of Kan`d`oo. Vaayu with Kapha is responsible for Karn`a Kan`d`oo according to Maadhava Nidaana. Karn`a Goothaka: Pitta and Teja dry out the Kapha in the Karn`a Srotas causing Karn`a Goothaka. Karn`a Pratinaaha: When Wax in the ear (Karn`a Mala), liquefies and traverse to the Ghraan`a Mukha then it manifests with Karn`a Pratinaaha and S`hirobhitaapa. There is Vaatas`hoshita S`hleshmaa, in the pathogenesis of Karn`a Pratinaaha. Krimi Karn`aka: There is formation of Krimi. This is Krimi Karn`aka. There is Rakta and Maamasa Dusht`i.

On the heap of Panchaanga_s put the Tila Naala Kaasht`ha_s and burn it. After total burning of the heap of the tree parts and Tila Naala, allow it to cool. Now, separate the ash from the heated limestone. Now, take one Dron`a of Bhasma (Ash) about 12.250 Kgs. And mix it with 6 Dron`a of Water or cows urine (Gomootra) - about 15 Kgs. And strain it through a cloth 21 times. Now, take this strained water in a flat iron vessel (Kat`aaha) and boil it till it becomes clear, reddish, and irritating to skin and slimy.

If the appearances of burn starts appearing before the completion of 100 count, it indicates that it is (Teekshn`a) strong in action, Kshaara; if not, it is taken that it is Mridu Kshaara. Qualities of the best Kshaara: S.Su. 11-15 It should not be too strong or too weak. It should be soft to the touch, sticky and should not be watery [Hygroscopic].

It also causes sterility when given excessively. D`alhan`a says that it should not be used in a clean wound as a clean wound heals naturally and Ropan`a activity is an indirect effect of Kshaara. How the Kshaara Acts? A.H.Su. 30-25,26. When the Kshaara is applied on the skin or tissue, first there is irritation followed by inflammatory process resulting Edema, dragging pain and pressure finally resulting in separation of Dusht`a Dosha and all signs and symptoms of Kshaara disappear. As per Modern medicine, its action is alkaline in nature acquired through the lime Diseases cured by Kshaara when applied externally: Kusht`ha, Kit`abha, Dadru, Mand`ala, Kilaas, Bhagandara, Arbuda, Ars`ha, Dusht`a, Vran`a, Charmakeela, Tilkaalaka, Nyachchha, Vyanga, Mashaka, External Vidradhi, Kreemi, Visha.

It is also contraindicated in the patients having generalized Oedema, Ascitis, pregnancy, and menstruation phase of a lady, diabetics, painful conditions, recently traumatized patients, and sterility, Udvritta or Apavritta Phalayoni. It should not be applied on Marma, Siraa, Snaayu, Sandhi, Tarun`aasthi, Sevani, Dhamani, Gala, Naabhi, and edges of nails, Med`hra and Alpamaamsa. Except the eyelids not anywhere on the eye. Even though, the condition is an absolute pointer to Kshaarakarma, it should not be used in paralytic conditions, patients with Asthishoola, having severe anorexia, and pain in Precordial region Method of Application of Kshaara: S.Su. 11-18, 19 to 22, and A.H.Su. 30- 27, 28, 30. With all the things prepared, the physician must inspect the area where the Kshaarakarma is to be carried out. If there is Pittadusht`i, scrub a little, if there is Vaatadusht`i, perform a deep scrapping, if Kaphadusht`i is there, make blood letting by taking superficial incisions. Apply Kshaara by means of Kaarpaasakritoshn`eesha S`halaakaa and count upto 100. In case of piles, keep Ars`ho Yantra as it is with its mouth closed. If it is to be applied on eyelids, fold the lid, cover the other parts of eye with a swab dipped in cold water and apply Kshaara of a breadth of kamala Parn`a.

After the application of Kshaara, and keeping it for the time mentioned or development of signs as said, wash the Kshaara with Kaanjee or any of the Amla substance, and then apply honey and ghee. If there is no response to the Kshaara therapy, apply Kaanjeekaa, Mahalunga Rasa, Sesum indicum, and honey. Tilakalka, Yasht`imadhu (Glyceriza Gabia) and ghee are the best mixture for Vran`a Ropan`a after Kshaara Karma. Why the Kshaara should be washed with sour substances? S.Su. 11-2225. Kshaara has Ushn`a and Teekshn`a properties, thus application of Amla substance due to its S`heeta Gun`a lowers the Ushna Gun`a of Kshaara. Salt taste predominates in Kshaara, while sour taste predominates in the Amla Rasa  when both these Rasa_s are mixed together, they produce Madhura Rasa, which is Saumya. It is nothing but a neutralization process. Kshaara is hot to the touch while Amla substance is S`heeta to the touch. So that this or instantaneous contact is limitation of further action of Kshaara on the tissues. Signs and symptoms of Samyak Dagdha, Heena Dagdha and Atidagdha: by Kshaara. S.Su.11-26, 27 and A.H.Su. 30-34,35. This produces thickened redness, inflammation, increased discharge, body ache, fatigue, thirst, fainting and heavy bleeding.

Chi.26, S.Sha.6, A. H. Sha.4 Definition: Marma are the 107 particular vital points in body. Trauma to these vital points leads to instantaneous death, rigorous pain or enduring disability. Marma are 107 vital points described in which there is a aggregation of Siraa, Maamsa, Snaay , Asthi, Sandhi and particularly Praan`a (Agni, Soma, Vaayu, Satva, Raja, Tama , Panchendriya Bhotaatmaa.) inhabit naturally hence trauma to these points lead in instant death. Marma as also described as the areas on the body, which exhibit pain on pressure or odd pulsation (of Siraa and Dhamanee) are observed. Though Marma are said to of types segregated according to Siraa , Maamsa Snaayu , Asthi , Sandhi based on Praan`ayatana they are assumed as unique. Knowledge of Marma is essential as Marma Adhikaara covers half part of surgical application. Types of Marma according to fatal intensity: Sadya Praan`ahara Marma:- These are Agni Mahaabhoota Pradhaana so trauma to these Marma leads to instant death. Kaalantara Praa`na hara Marma:- These Marma are Soumya (Jala) and Agni Mahaabhoota Pradhaana, Jala Mahaabhoota reduces the intense attribute of Agni and thus trauma to these Marma lead to death after some span of time. Vis`halyaghna Marma:- These Marma are Vaayu Mahaabhootapradhaana, therefore in case of injury caused by any weapon to this Marma the patient sUrveeves until the weapon or the foreign body is intact at the site of these vital points. However, on extraction of the weapon or the foreign body the patient dies. This is because the tip of the foreign body obstructs Vaayu at the site of Marma and thus the life sustained but on extraction of weapon of foreign body, the Vaayu passes on from the site of Marma leading to death. However, if foreign body comes out after suppuration (Paaka) the patient may sUrveeve. Vaikalyakara Marma :- These Marma are Soma Gun`a Pradhaana hence due to stability and cold properties thus injury to these Marma causes disability but sustains life. Rujaakara Marma:- These Marma are Vaayu and Agni Mahaabhootapradhaana, hence injury to these Marma leads to drastic pain also some opine these Marma as Paanchabhauteeka. Four types of Siraa Viz. Vaata, Pitta, Kappa, and Rakta Vaha Siraa nourish Siraa Snaayu, Maamsa, Asthi Sandhi and the whole body. Therefore, injury to Marma causes severe bleeding resulting Raktakshaya that further leads to Vaataparkopa causing various types of pains. After this Pitta also gets aggravated causing symptoms like Trishn`aa,S`hosha, Mada etc. ultimately leading to death Difference of opinion based on qualitative concern In addition, these have respectively, lesser qualitative involvement to form a Marma. However, this is not true as even trauma to AsthiMarma causes bleeding. Ghaatakaakaala: - Sadya Praan`ahara Marma is 7 days or instant death. Kaalantarapraan`ahara Marma is from 15 days to one month. Effects of Trauma the peripheral site of Marma If the trauma is exactly at the midpoint of Marma, the symptoms are most intense and to the periphery, the symptoms are less intense. Classification:- Mahaamarma: -Basti, Hridaya, S`hira. According to Desha Bheda According to Pramaan`a Bheda According to Rachanaa Bheda Dhamanee Marma are described by Vaagbhat`a. According to Parin`aama Bheda According to Avayava Bheda Marma Aaghaata: Related Lakshan`a  When Marma like Kshipra or Talahridaya are injured, it causes severe hemorrhage and causes Vaataprakopa leading severe pain. However, when limbs are severed the blood vessels contract due to which there is minimal blood loss. So when there is injury to above Marma the extremities should be excised immediately. Due to trauma at the site of Marma, the person may immediately die even if they survive due to surgeons efficacy he/she will definitely suffer from disability. Person may survive even if he is having injury to trunk, skull or body parts injured or even suffering from traumatic amputation of extremities if Marma are not involved. Symptoms due to traumatic incision, excision, tearing, infringement, burning at the adjacent part are analogous to symptoms of Marmaghaata.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b74c2ded-8520-47d6-84ce-e0e288a28216": {"__data__": {"id_": "b74c2ded-8520-47d6-84ce-e0e288a28216", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"tag": "p", "file_path": "/home/dai/rag/data/clean_html/Articles/S`halya_S`haalaakya/Mridvikarana.htm", "file_name": "Mridvikarana.htm", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 698, "creation_date": "2024-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-14", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-15", "summary": "Mridvikaran`a is the process of softening the wound edges, which can become hard and rough during the healing process.

Pr. Dr.R.B.Gogte Ayurveda says that no one science is perfect and one must get the help of other related sciences and give a relief to the patient in the best way without producing new complications. Along with the knowledge of Charaka, Sus`hruta and Vaagbhat`a, I have also studied many other books on other paths. My favorite books are Surgical Anatomy by Mc.Gregor, Surgical pathology by Ellingworth, Principles of Surgery by Schwartz, Chinese Acupuncture and Moxibustion by Cheng Xinnong and Hasti Ayurveda by Paalakaapya. After practicing and teaching surgery, it appears to me that Modern Surgery is a Replica of Ayurvedic Surgery (minus changes due to anaesthesia, investigation facilities  pathology, Radiology etc.). I have quoted few examples only to support my understanding (S.Chi. 14/18) Viddha is to dig hole or puncture. The cavity is punctured to evacuate fluid (or to insert some inert gas). By this route also fluid and blood may be administered to children. The customary site chosen is a point 1below & 1 to the left of the umbilicus. The needle can be felt to pierce first the anterior sheath of the rectus, then the post - rectus sheath and peritoneum as it enters the cavity. The bowel in this situation is the small intestines. This gut is freely mobile and if encountered is displaced by the needles without injury. (A synopsis of surgical anatomy page 758, by M.C.Gregor) Ayurveda advocates the same procedure but it is little bit at the lower and outer levels at about 5 cms. with an additional advantage of immediate entry into the peritoneal cavity by piercing the anterior rectus sheath. Abdominal Incision in Obstruction and Perforation: S.Chi. 14/17 This is a pararectal (muscle) incision. On the left side it divides anterior rectus sheath in the line of the skin cut, the rectus is pulled in words. The post. rectus sheath in the line of the skin cut, fascia, transversalis and peritoneum in the line of the skin cut. This incision may be prolonged up or down or both to give access to the pelvis and ascending colon. The advantage in this incision when anaesthesia was not available was of suturing all the cut structures in one suture line. The incision is a little modification  i.e. it is still below where the post rectus sheath falls short and little away from the border of the rectus muscle. It is always on the left side as the intestines are more mobile and are less liable to injury during the cutting  procedures on abdominal wall. (Synopsis of Surgical Anatomy Mc.Gregor, Page 676) S.Chi.2/56 In perforation of the G.I. tract here Ayurveda has used a non-absorbable material of animal origin. (Tongs of the big black ants) Very easy to apply in a short time and very firm. (Easy way of surgery when anaesthesia was not available) It is just like the clips used in laparoscopic surgery. The writer himself has used it in Frogs C.I. tract, the stomach and proved it to be successful. Peritoneal Lavage In Perforation And Peritonitis - S.Chi.2/57 This is washing of the intestines and peritoneal cavity in perforation (G.I.tract) 1000 yr. B.C. The material used was milk. Intra operative high volume lavage  This treatment involves extensive intra-operative lavage of the entire abdominal cavity by 1 to 1.5 L. of physiological saline or Ringers Solution, which is placed in the abdominal cavity. The viscera are manipulated so that the fluid reaches all part of the abdominal cavity to wash pus, faeces, necrotic material and then the fluid is suctioned off. S.Chi. 14/17 Haemorrhage in Gastro intestinal tract. It may involve stomach or colon. The treatment is removal of the clotted blood /blood from G.I. tract by vomiting or by purging (modern treatment enemata) S.Chi. 2-17 S.Chi. 2/16.17 S.Chi. 2/52 Gastro intestinal bleeding  Principles of surgery. Schwartz page 1032 Gastro intestinal tract bleeding is usually divided into upper gastro intestinal (Aamaas`hayagata) and lower gastrointestinal (Pakvaas`hayagata) U.G.I. bleeding is usually from a source in the Oesophagus, stomach and duodenum, whereas LGI bleeding is usually from the colon, rectum or terminal ileum. Vomiting of blood usually represents U.G.I. bleeding proximal to the ligament of treitz while coffee ground vomitus usually is slower rate bleeding. Lesions below the ligament of treitz that bleed are considered as L.G.I. Treatment  A textbook of surgical pathology Elingworth Page 248. Apart from the blood loss and resulting hypoxia, Haemorrhage into gastro intestinal tract has been thought to be harmful through absorption of products derived from extravagated blood. It is known that blood urea level commonly rises and this has been ascribed to absorption of blood products from intestines. Though it is clear that a rise of blood urea may be a result from hypoxic renal damage. The blood is removed by stomach wash or Colonic wash. Matress horizontal interrupted sutures Simple stitch (interrupted) a suture formed by a single stitch inserted separately, the needle usually being passed through one lip of wound from without outwards and another from within outwards. Continuous  spiral. The closure of wound by mean of one continuous thread usually by transfixing one edge of the wound Subcuticular. A buried continuous suture in which the needle is passed horizontally under the epidermis, the cutis vera. 1871 Tabers cyclopaedic medical dictionary. Suturing Needles: Straight cutting Straight round body Curved round body S.Su. 34/5 S.Chi. 34/5 This is the eyeless, a traumatic needle, curved to be used for suturing the Gastro-intestinal structures, stomach, colon. The eyeless needle is the latest invention in Modern Science.

The cause is hypoprotenimia. It is also one of the causes of wound disruption. Blood transfusion plasma or protinex is given in modern surgery. Ayurveda recommends a meat diet. Lithotomy or Edebohis Position S.Chi. 7/30 The patient in dorsal decubitus with hips and knees flexed and thighs abducted and externally rotated. Dorsal position, the knees and thighs drawn up, legs flexed on thighs and thighs flexed on belly, the hip raised and thigh abducted. Left lateral position, Sims position 18 C. C.3 A patient lies on the left side with chest, right knee and thigh drawn up; the left arm is along the back Basti  Sadyo Praan`ahara Marma Extravasation of Urine It only becomes Praan`ahara in trauma or during the surgery of removal of stone, if the bladder gets cut at two places resulting in extravasation of urine in abdomen. Sterile urine is extremely irritating to the peritoneum the chemical result is frequently followed by secondary infection. It also initiates bacterial peritonitis. In addition to the direct peritoneal irritation caused by hyperosmolar urine, re-absorption of acidic metabolic acid end products and urea leads to acidosis and uraemia. (Pg. 1466 Principles of Surgery. Schwaartz) S. Chi 7/33 I have seen such two patients one of TUR when the current jumped and resulted in intra-peritoneal rupture of bladder resulting in death even when prompt treatment was given by suturing the bladder and drainage when anaesthesia was available. I have also seen another patient when the bladder was opened at two places accidentally during an operation of tubectomy. Prompt treatment was given and the patient was serious for one month but later on recovered. It was her good luck! Think of surgery at a time when anaesthesia was not available! Haemostasis is a must before you suture the wound S.Su.25 S.Su. 14 S.Chi.2 A.H.Su.29/49 Haematoma impairs wound healing by providing a medium for bacterial infection (Paaka) as well as it acts as the mechanical barrier to the opposition of tissue edges. The surgeon should be fastidious in assuming; there is no bleeding before closure  Schwartz. Principles of surgery 457. Prolonged bleeding or clothing time important factor in Plastic surgery Haematoma forming under split thickness skin grafts and prevents vascularization and adherence, with subsequent graft failure. Similarly haematomas forming under soft tissue flaps may impair blood supply, leading to flap necrosis. Underlying disorders of coagulation (Askandi and Chirastraavi) both acquired and hereditary increase the likelihood of this complication. An increase in number of haematomas following plastic surgery procedures in patients experiencing postoperative hypertension (S`heeghram) has been reported. S.Su. 14/21 S`heegrah  With forced spurts.

The goal of local Haemostasis is to prevent the flow of blood from incised or transected blood vessels. This may be accomplished by interrupting the flow of blood to the involved area or by direct closure of the blood vessel wall defect. The technique may be classified as mechanical-digital pressure, tight bandage, direct pressure applied by mean of packs, ligation of bleeder (suturing) Sandhaaan  Thermal 1. Electro cautery. Heat achieves Haemostasis by denaturation of proteins. Daaha (Ayurveda advocates this method as a last resort because, its disadvantage is that more tissue is necrosed than with precise ligature which modern medicine also accepts. Temp is 20 to 100 M.A) 2. Extreme cooling  Skandana. This is caused by dehydration and denaturation of lipid molecules. Temp is 20 to 180 o C. Chemical Agents (Bhasma) + Kashaaya Rasa + S`heet Pichchhaa Dravya Chemical agents vary in their Haemotatic action. Some are vaso constrictive, while others have coagulant properties. Still others are relatively inert but possess hygroscopic properties, which increase their bulk and dig in plugging disrupted blood vessels. Schwartz, Principles of Surgery Khadira  hygroscopic.

S.Su.14/36 S.Su. 14/9 S.Su. 14/30 Ayurveda advocates oral blood of different animals as rabbit, buffalo etc. Modern science advocates I.V. Blood transfusions. Blood has been described as a vehicular organ that perfuse all other organs. It provides transportation of oxygen to satisfy the bodys metabolic demands and removes the by-product carbon dioxide. Blood also transports chemical nutrients and waste products from metabolic activity Haemotatic governors including hormones, coagulation factors, and antibodies are carried to and from appropriate sites within the fluid portion of the blood. Red blood cells, with their oxygen carrying capacity, white blood cells, which function in body defense processes and platelets, which contribute to the Haemotatic process, comprise the formed elements. This proves the Paanchabhautikatva of blood Principles of surgery  Schwarthz Page 111 According to Ayurveda all traumatic wounds are to be sutured as it helps quick healing of a wound with some contraindications. A.H.Su. 29/49 S.Chi. 1/15 All postoperative and deep wounds are to be sutured S.Su. 25/17 A.H.Su. 49/51 S.Chi 1.45 C. Chi. 25/65 Wounds in mobile zones, suspected foreign body, pus or Haemorrhage inside Wounds created by wild animals Tracheostomy, of lungs opening outside, 3 wounds contaminated with chemicals and of burns Ayurveda also states that if the muscles are cut they are also to be Re-sutured. 4 Post-operative wounds after doing the surgery, for obstruction, perforation, removal of cysts etc. are to be sutured. S.Chi. 2/56-61 Wound healing has been described throughout recorded history. Empirically, the ancients recognized that foreign bodies and dead tissues must be removed from wounds. They knew that cleanliness prevents infection and pus required drainage  Wound elixirs such as honey decreased wound suppuration (hyopertonic glucose is bactericidal) and fresh open wounds could be closed primarily using hairs, cloth or insert jaws. Principles of surgery, Schwartz p. 279 Suturing Materials in Ayurveda S.Su. 25-20-21 Non-absorbable. Hairs threads derived from cotton, silk, jute and tendrils of climbers heads of black big ants. Absorbable  Snaayuprataana  muscle or facial strips The materials used for wound closure are much less important than the technique of closure. Basically sutures may be classified as absorbable and non-absorbable. The absorbable are synthetic such as poly-glycolic acid or biologic such as catgut  (Snaayuprataana), which is plain or chromium treated. They are absorbed and will not be nidus for late infection. Non-absorbable sutures are used on the skin because they are less reactive and allegedly provide a better appearing scar. Any woven suture is more prone to infection than a smooth suture because bacteria can become entrapped in the interstices a woven suture and are not destroyed by normal host response. Principles of Surgery Schwartz A.H.Su. 29/56 In doing secondary suturing the edges of the ulcer/wound should be scraped till it bleeds and then the suturing should be done. In delayed primary closure. Delay in closure is indicated to prevent infection in those wounds where there is significant bacterial contamination, foreign bodies or extensive tissue trauma. In the open wound being prepared for delayed primary closure, angiogenesis proceeds to provide enhance blood supply and needed oxygen. Leukocytes are attracted to destroy and remove bacteria. (This is only possible when there is free bleeding from scraped edges of old wound) 280 principles of surgery  Schwartz Sutures are to be removed on the seventh day as the treatment for traumatic Wound or operate wound is only for seven days, modern science says the same.

It could be due to trauma or due to a surgical procedure. This is also called Aagantu Vran`a. But Sadyovran`a is differentiated from Aagantu Vran`a due to its special property of healing within the seven days if it does not get infected, and it produces a burning sensation immediately after trauma, which is usually relieved I.e. by cold fomentation or the application of Ghrita and honey. If the patient comes suffering from Sadyovran`a, the first thing to see is whether he has developed any signs and symptoms of Marmaaghaata. If so, Marmaaghaata is to be treated first and then the other ailment, depending upon the type of injury. Classification of Sadyovran`a: Chhinna Vran`a Usually a type of cut injury where is slight trauma to the muscles and bones Kshataja Vran`a This is a penetrating wound and is usually caused by sharp-pointed substances like horns of animals, knives and bullets. After treating the Marmaaghaata, if present, the first thing is to see whether there is any infected or foreign material in the wound in the form of small stones nail, pieces of wood, bullets, grass etc, if they are present, they should be removed immediately. If there is any injury to muscles, fascia, or vessels, they are also to be repaired immediately. Torn lacerated skin or the fascia or the muscles are to be removed and sutured. After confirming that there is no internal hemorrhage, the wound is to be sutured layer-wise. Now, this sutured wound is treated for 7 days as stated in the texts (A.H.Su.26-13) If the wound is heavily infected, no immediate suturing should be done, till the wound becomes clean and then it can be sutured. This type of suturing is called secondary suturing. In cases of all Non-surgical traumatic injuries, Aamapaachana Chikitsaa is essential, which includes all antibiotics and antiseptics according to modern medical science. Even in a clean-sutured wound, if the patient develops redness, itching or pain at the site of suturing, immediately a few sutures should be removed to allow the infection to be drained and Aamapaachana Chikitsaa should be given. Treatment for Non-Infected Sadyovran`a: Dhoopana Chikitsaa Twice in a day as mentioned in the Shasht`hee Upakrama_s. Avasechana by Yasht`imadhu Ghrita and Balaa Taila for seven days Removal of sutures on the 7 th day and in case of the face, on the 5 th day [The Tvachaa being the Upadhaatu of Maamsa Dhaatu, as per Dhaatu Utpatti Krama, it takes 5 to 7 days to heal] C. Chi. 15-17 From Rasa Rakta Maamsa Meda Asthi Majjaa S`hukra Days  {1 5 10 15 20 25 30 {1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Aagantu Vran`a This type of Vran`a is always produced due to different types of traumas. It also includes the traumas caused by heat, Kshaara, Teekshn`a Aushadhi, and Visha or poison. Aagantu Vran`a_s are supposed to be aseptic for 7 days, and that is why, the treatment for Aagantu Vran`a is different than the other types of Vran`a_s. Though this is true, in practice, many a times these wounds get infected due to Dusht`a Dosha_s already existing in the body before their entry from the environment. In such a condition, it is expected that the treatment prescribed for the Aagantu Vran`a be stopped and shifted to the Dusht`a Vran`a management. Aagantu Vran`a also includes Sadyovran`a which is being caused by sharp object or incisions made by surgeons also. Aagantu Vran`a caused by heat (Dagdha Kshaara or Aushadhi are not sutured) Ayurveda has classified these Aagantu Vran`a as Chhinna, Bhinna, Viddha, Kshata, Pichchita, Ghrisht`a. The physician Vaagbhat`a classifies it as Ghrisht`a, Avakrutta, Vicchina, Pravilambita, Patita, Viddha, Bhinna, and Vidalita. Asht`aanga Samgraha classifies it as Ghrisht`a, Avakrita, Vichchhinna, Vilambita, Patita. Chhinna Vran`a In Chhinna Vran`a, usually, the part gets amputated or it is treated in the form of straight or oblique incised, wound. Bhinna Vran`a For the wound, which happens to be on a part which has one of the following e.g. urine, blood, undigested food or an abscess or a Vidradhi. After the trauma on these parts, the contents that are inside are drained out, and that is why, it is called Bhinna. If it is on the Pakvaas`haya, it will drain faecal material; if it is on Phuphphusa, it will drain air and if it is on Mootraas`haya, it will drain urine. Sometimes, Bhinna Vran`a is also produced by a simple trauma penetrating the peritoneal cavity without injuring the Kosht`hastha Avayava_s. Although this Bhinna Vran`a is particularly related to Kosht`haanga_s, some signs and symptoms are common to all, which include fainting, retention of faeces and urine, Aadhmaana, S`hvaasa. Sometimes it is accompanied by pain the chest. Viddha Vran`a This is a penetrating wound where the external opening is almost invisible or very small, but the internal injury may be great. This Viddha Vran`a is sub classified into Anuviddha ii. Uttun`d`ita iii. Atividdha iv. Nirviddha v. Anubhinna vi. Bhinnottun`d`ita vii Atibhinna viii Nirbhinna. Sometimes, we get a foreign body in different types of wounds e.g. A thorn, may remain inside even after making a Viddha Vran`a. Kshataja Vran`a this falls between the Chhinna and Bhinna. The peculiarity is that this wound has an irregular surface. Pichchita Vran`a This is always caused by the bilateral pressure or a trauma, if the extremity is fixed over a hard surface. Usually, the bones are affected in such types of injury. Many a times there is no external injury except loss of its normal contour. Such injury is usually flat. Vaagbhat`as Viddha Vran`a is included under this category. This could be sub-classified as 1. Savran`a 2. Avran`a. Ghrisht`a Vran`a This is like a lacerated wound, where there is partial loss of skin. It is usually, accompanied by severe burning and a watery discharge. Krita and Avakrita Vran`a This is a sub-variety of Ghrisht`a Vran`a where the subcutaneous tissue is also damaged. Vicchinna Vran`a This is the next step of Vicchinna. The wound lies still deeper. Pravilambita Vran`a Where the bone remains as it is, but the muscles, blood vessels, skin etc. are seen hanging. Patita Vran`a In this Vran`a, part of the body gets separated from the body. Vidalita Vran`a This is nothing but a synonym for Pichchita Vran`a. Treatment: The first line of treatment is related to Marmaaghaata, if noticed. Control of bleeding if it exists. Removal of foreign body, if inside Total cleansing of the wound, if it is not of the Bhinna type. If it is in relation to Kosht`haanga, exploration of the abdominal or thoracic cavity is indicated. If it is of a superficial type, suturing can be done in the long cut wound. In Pichchita and Ghrisht`a Vran`a, S`heeta Lepa and Parisheka is indicated. In the Ghrisht`a Vran`a, Avachoorn`ana is to be performed. In the Avakritta Vran`a, Kalka_s are to be applied. In the Vicchinna and Pravilambita Vran`a_s, Sevanaadi Upakrama_s are to be carried out. In the Patita Vran`a, Sevana is indicated. In general, for all types of wounds, there should be immediate sprinkling of Yasht`imadhu Ghrita or Balaa Taila. In the Kshataja Vran`a, especially Lepa_s with Kashaaya, Madhura, S`heeta and Snigdha qualities to be applied Good`haprahaaraabhighaata (Contusions / Sprains) these types of injuries are caused by lifting weights, fall from trees, twisting of limbs of due to a simple fall. This type of injury is usually presented as pain, burning sensation, and loss of consciousness. Sometimes, such types of symptoms are also produced due to heavy work or trauma on a Marma. Treatment: Tub bath of oil or lukewarm water. Abhyanga and Mardana Fomentation Local fomentation by heated pulp of coconut core, mixed with Bhallataka and Haridraa The same is to be retained there for one night. Diet Easily digestible, Balya and if possible, it should be supplemented with a non-vegetarian diet. Special treatment of different types of Bhinna Vran`as: If it is without any injury, if the abdominal wound is sufficiently larger after application of Ghrita, the intestines are to be replaced in the abdominal cavity and suturing should be carried out. If the abdominal wound is small, then it is to be extended upwards or downwards and the intestines are to be replaced in the abdominal cavity and other parts are also to be examined for injury. If the intestines come out with the injury to the lumen of the intestines, then such type of wound on the intestines is to be sutured. The suturing material that is used is black Pippilikaa (black big ants). Approximate the wound on the intestines and apply the ants, as soon as they take a bite, cut off the ants body from the head. This is the first non-absorbable material belonging to the arthropode category. The author himself applied this technique on the stomach of frogs and the healing was very satisfactory. If the wound and abdominal cavity is contaminated by mud, grass particles etc., then the whole abdominal cavity (Udaraguhaa) and viscera are to be washed with milk and then only to be replaced inside. So, the concept of peritoneal lavage was not new to Ayurveda during that era also. If the patient reports to you after a long time, then before putting the intestines inside, they should be fully bathed with ghee and milk till their dryness goes off. Then they are to be replaced inside. This is nothing but similar to draping up the small intestines with saline soaked towels. After suturing the abdomen, a diet is to be worked out gradually. Water with milk, only milk, semisolid, and full diet; or water, non-veg, soup, semi-non-veg diet and the non-veg diet. To prevent constipation, castor oil with ghee should be given internally. This concept of cutting the Omentum with a red-hot knife is nothing but to achieve the haemostasis, as the omentum has many free vessels that are likely to bleed. The second purpose of cutting the Omentum with red-hot knife is to prevent infection. After doing this procedure, the abdominal wall is to be sutured. In this particular condition, the patient is put on defatted milk diet. Usually after this surgery a severe burning pain is present; to alleviate this, sugar mixed water along with Yasht`imadhu and castor is given orally. Remove the foreign body. After its removal usually Mastulunga (cerebro-spinal fluid) (Straava) outflow starts. If it comes out in excess, death may be the outcome. In order to prevent this complication, a big bunch of hair is inserted inside the wound and as the wound goes on healing, the hair is removed one by one gradually. If it is without foreign body, simple bunch is inserted. If there is only a cut wound over the scalp, then the wound is to be sutured. If accompanied by depressed fracture, the skull bone is elevated and the wound sutured. If the injury is up to the meningeal coverings with oozing of CSF, the treatment given above is to be followed If the injury is up to the Mastulunga (brain matter), and if the Mastulunga is damaged, then no treatment is required, as death follows. If the eyeball comes out of the socket of orbit with its attachments intact, then after application of Ghrita, it is to be put back in its socket with the use of a tender leaf, preferably that of lotus and then, other treatments of Sadyovran`a will follow. Diagnostic measures, which were used by Ayurveda in the case of Bhinna Vran`a on the gastro-intestinal tract are as follows As soon as the patient reports to you for treatment of the abdominal wound, watch for the type of discharge. If it is faecal matter, it is likely to be small intestine and if it is frothy slimy yellow or green material coming out with or without food particles, it is likely to be gastric. [Complications of wound or ulcer] The manifestations occurring or developing during the healing process of a Vran`a or even after its healing are called Vran`opadrava. They may be in the form of another disease. These can occur after surgical procedures also, as a result of the either the surgeons error or as a sequel of diseases condition itself. Generally these Upadrava_s subside as soon as the original wound heals. But this is not always the case; many times, Upadrava_s becomes more troublesome than the original wound and hence require quick treatment. They are classified as follow- The most troublesome amongst these Vran`opadrava_s is Apataanaka, which is nothing but intermittent contractions and relaxations of body muscles causing intense movements of the body resulting in fatigue. If this Apataanaka continues, it leads to Dand`aapataanaka, where the body becomes rigid and bent internally and externally. Internal curving of body is known as Dhanusht`ambha / Antaraayaama and external bending as Bahiraayaama. Vaagbhat`a has called this as Vran`aayama, while Maadhava Nidaana classifies it as Aptantraka and Apataanaka as the Avasthaa of Aakshepaka. This is mainly due to the effects of Vaatavaha Naad`i_s. According to Dosha, they are classified as Kaphaanvita Vaataja Pittaanvita Vaataja Keval Vaataja Abhighaataja Some people also classify them as Apataanaka Sanshrisht`a Aakshepaka (Kaphaanvita Vaataja) Keval Aakshepaka (Keval Vaataja) Abhighaataja Sometimes this Aakshepaka results in difficulty in respiration, deglutition, and sometimes fracture of the bones of limbs, ribs or pelvis. According to modern science, this condition is put under the heading of tetanus. The causative organism of this condition is an anaerobic bacillus called claustridium tetani. As this is caused by anaerobic organisms, it is more common in Viddha or sutured injuries or if the wound is contaminated with horse dung. The symptoms may start after injuries from 48 hrs to 6 months. This is usually caused by the presence toxins on the nerve endings. The earlier onset of signs and symptoms, the graver is the prognosis. The early onset of lock-jaw, the more grave the prognosis. Lock jaw is produced due to the spasm of the facial muscles, especially the muscles of mastication. The look on the face is very peculiar, which is comparable to moneys face and hence called rhesus sardonicus. This condition is also common especially after abortion, delivery as the woman is Vran`ita or in the newborn babies due to infection of the umbilicus. Preventive measures include total aseptic precautions, injection of tetanus toxoid prior to surgery and immediately after trauma with ulcer. If tetanus sets in, Anti-Tetanus serum is indicated intravenously. The dose that varies from 5 Lac to 10 Lac I.U. sometimes, intra-spinal penicillin helps in improving the condition. The supportive treatment is IV fluids for nutrition, and drugs like paraldehyde, magnesium sulphate to stop convulsions. If the patient is unable to swallow anything, feeding is done through a ryles tube. If the patient undergoes respiratory difficulties, tracheostomy or artificial respiration is indicated. The other things that are to be done in this patient is to avoid pricks, especially intra-muscularly, to keep him away from noise and keep in a dark room with eyes covered to prevent the glare of a powerful light.

Saadhyaasaadhyatva: Vaataja Pittaja Kaphaja Saadhya Granthi Kardama and Agnivisarpa (unless there is Marmasthaanas involvement) Krichchhrasaadhya Sannipaatika and Kshataja Asaadhya Treatment: Vaayu Kot`ha (Gas Gangrene) This condition is produced by the infection of the clostridium velchii. We get multiple vesicles at the site of the trauma, which spreads rapidly. The pulse is fast with high temperature. If the infection is heavy, death occurs soon. Treatment: Excision of dead tissue. If necessary, amputation of the limb. Administration of anti-gas gangrene serum (05 Lac units). Other antibiotics to control secondary infection. Jalasantraasa (Hydrophobia): This is caused by the dog bite already infected with rabdo virus. The route of entry is through the saliva of the dog during bite. Even the contaminated saliva on the skin could also produce this condition. After the infection, constant painful contractions of muscles of deglutition starts and the patient fears drinking water and hence the name hydrophobia. The incubation period is 1 to 3 months. Earlier onset on record is 10 days and as late as 1 year. The period depends on the place of bite, load of virus, type of animal (dog, monkey, rat, cat etc.) and the time spent for treatment. Bite on Face, skull or neck 34 days Forearm 46 days Legs 78 days The virus enters the brain through the circulating blood and develops nigri bodies. Signs and Symptoms: bodyache, headache, temperature, itching and pain at the site of injury; cannot tolerate light or cold breeze. Excessive perspiration, salivation, contraction of muscles, watering from eyes, irritability and difficulty in deglutition. Lastly, the noise of water or word water induces spasm of the muscles of deglutition. Patient develops convulsions or paralysis and lastly death occurs as the final and inevitable outcome. Saadhyaasaadhyatva: Nobody survives Treatment: Cleaning of the wound by carbolisation (application of Carbolic acid) Preventive treatment No suturing Confirmation of madness of the dog Death occurs within 10 days from setting up of the symptoms Antirabies vaccine 3,7,10, or 14 injections.

Vaataja: This Vidradhi is black in colour. It is Parusha. There is severe pain. This S`hotha manifests with different ways. This is Vaataja Vidradhi. The secretions are thin (Tanu). Pittaja: This resembles to ripened fruit of Udumbara. It may be of S`hyaava (gray) color. There is Jvara and Daaha. It manifests quickly. It ripens / suppurates quickly. The secretions are yellow coloured (Peeta). Kaphaja: It resembles to an earthen vessel. It is whitish and cold to touch. It is stable. There is mild pain. It manifests with longer duration. It suppurates too lately. There is Kan`d`oo also. The secretions are white colored (Sita). Saannipaatika: There are different colored secretions, pain. The Ghaat`aala (The upper part) of the Vidradhi is large in size. It is irregular in size (Vishama). It is Asaadhya.  Kshataja / Abhighaataja: Due to the trauma there is formation of wound. The heat at the wound gets spread due to Vaayu which provokes Pitta with Rakta. There is Jvara, Trishn`aa, Daaha. This is Aagantu Vidradhi which manifests same as Pitta Vidradhi.

Gulma is like a bubble in the water which manifest in the Srotas, it resembles to Vaata Granthi, therefore it does not get suppurate (as there is no involvement of Rakta and Maamsa in the pathogenesis of Gulma); whereas Vidradhi is having Maamsa and Rakta as Dooshya, it gets suppurated. Asthigata Vidradhi: Vidradhi manifested on the Asthi causes suppuration of Majjaa. When these suppurated Majjaa Dhaatu can not drain out then it causes severe burning pain. Due to this heat produced in the Majjaa, there is severe pain. When this gets drained out, there is unctuous (Snigdha), white colored secretions which is cold to touch.

Nija and Aagantu Vran`a, both differ by their Hetu (causative factors), Lakshan`a (signs and symptoms) and Chikitsaa. Mantra (Spiritual Chanting) etc. are used for the Aagantu Vran`a. In Aagantu Vran`a, when there is association of Dosha, and when these Aagantu Vran`a are not subsided by their own treatment then it is necessary to treat Aagantu Vran`a by the guidelines of Nija Vran`a.

Su. 18/30  Bradhna (Antra Vriddhi) It is the swelling in the inguinal and scrotal region caused by Vaata, Pitta and Kapha. These are characterized by signs and symptoms of aggravated Doshaa_s. The Antra enters in and exits out of the scrotal region repeatedly.(Antram Nireti Pravis`hen Muhuh Cha) (C. Chi. 12/94) It may be filled with urine or Medas then, this S`hotha becomes unctuous and hard (Snigdha and Kat`hina) (C. Chi. 12/94) Types of Vriddhi according to Sus`hruta Sampraapti Any Dosha out of three Doshaa_s, gets aggravated in the lower body (Adhah Kaaya). It traverses into the Phalakos`havaahinee and Dhamanee, manifesting Vriddhi. There may be enlargement of single testis. It is not necessary that both the testes should enlarge. Prodromal symptoms Vaata Vriddhi This is like the inflated bladder (Vaata Poorn`a Basti). It is hard to touch. There is pain without any specific cause. It is Vaataja Vriddhi. Pitta Vriddhi This Vriddhi resembles to completely ripened Udumbara. There is Jvara, Daaha, Ushmaa. This Vriddhi manifests and suppurates quickly. S`hleshma Vriddhi This Vriddhi is Kat`hina (Hard), with relatively less pain (Alpa Vedanaa), cold to touch (S`heeta), there is itching (Kan`d`oo). Rakta Vriddhi There are black colored blisters (Krishn`a Sphot`a). There are the symptoms same as Pitta Vriddhi. Medo Vriddhi It it soft (Mridu), unctuous (Snigdha), there is itching (Kan`d`oo), there is relatively less pain. It resembles to Taala Phala. Mootra Vriddhi This happens in a person who suppresses Mootra Vega (Natural urge to urine). In this type a person suffers from Mootrakrichchhra, Vrishan`a Vedanaa, Phala Kos`ha S`hvayathu. Aantra Vriddhi Vaata gets aggravated due to causative factors. This Vaata causes deformity in the part of the Aantra. (Sthoolaantrasya Ekades`he) It traverses down to the Vamkshan`a Sandhi. There it forms Granthi (Glandular growth). If it remains untreated, then it enters in to the Phalakos`ha (Scrotum) manifesting with oedema. There is distention of bladder (Aadhmaata Basti). The S`hotha is widespread. If it is manipulated, Vaata traverses upward with sound and when the pressure is released, it gets inflated again. This is called as Aantra Vriddhi.

Environmental material is suitably modified with the species-specific structure; there is essential co-existence of subtle or non-dimensional material with dimensional material. The cognizable material provides anchor to the subtle components. The constituents obligatory for the existence of any (living) being are the corpus the cluster of sense organs, pleasure / pain modulating system and a knowledge procuring component. The pain-pleasure exhibiting system versionizes received stimuli in a range from pain to pleasure or vice versa. Popularly it can be compared to the mind of a person. Aayu  term Manas (is opt by itself) cannot be fully transliterated as mind as the term mind has got its scientific limited definition. Despite the pain pleasure modulation; consciousness, soul or the knower inside the body; is aware of environmental stimuli. The main distinction between Manas and Aatmaa is that the first is behind the pain / pleasure classification; whereas the second is awareness of the inside and by the help of sense organs also of the outside. The consciousness, knower modifies the knowledge gained from the environmental stimuli any changes pain to pleasure or vice versa. An approaching disease causes change in pleasure / pain awareness for the same stimulus. The body normally craves for food intake, but when a disease is there transiently intake may be cause for pain instead of the usual pleasure. The innate protective subtle entity co-existing along with material cannot be described by characters, properties as having color, taste, smell, sound touch etc. The component is described therefore to be ultimate in fine nature and is located in all the parts of the body. Its existence can be known by changed desires; disgusts efforts for pleasure and efforts for avoiding pain are exhibited by beings depending upon their mobility. The soul or self or the conscious, Aatmaa possesses the (components of) body. In all languages, some one possessor repeatedly, states that it is his finger, his chest etc. The nature, properties, characters of these body components may change from sky to earth, but the possessor continues to say that is his (mine). Usually the owner states that is his shirt, wristwatch etc. There / the possessing owner and possessed entities are distinct and different from each other. When asked how do you do different from each other. When asked how do you do? The response is having a stomachache; my finger is swollen. If asked what did you do? The response is modified or stopped food intake, I did not move the finger. All will categorically express it. With modification in knowledge of body components, there in modification is receipt of environmental entities. Thus the usually unwanted sweater may be transiently pleasing when a person has fever. The Medical profession, therefore, should know in detail about the principle of awareness dwelling in the material body corpus. The season of progeny rearing is one, which exhibits modification in our usual behavior. The behavior of animals for 11-11 1/2 month and that during mating breeding season is substantially different. Human conception at time shows radical / diagonal modifications in desired / hated entities. That lasts usually till the delivery. Then the usual likes-dislikes once again prevail. Whenever one reaches to the stage of impending death, the desires and disgusts decrease to get almost nullified. But with conception there are strong desires / dislikes for a number of stimuli. The capacity to comprehend when exposed to experience of learning is not similar in all. A few do not learn In spite of years and years of legitimate input, whereas a few talented grasp and teach others even when not exposed. It is said that the talent is in-born. At times beings know the history, geography of time and location which they had no occasion to come across. So the real knowledge and exposure to teaching have no casual relation. All these observations and selfs inner awareness leading to modification of entities to be with or to avoid from; has guided appropriately to label somethings which are permanently shifting from body to body. Its ultimate goal is protective awareness. The approach of illness or recovery from it is first perceived by the conscious. Later on its knowledge is with the kith and kin, professional servants etc. Having cognized categorically that the existence of some non-dimensional fine most subtle entity is there, Aayu-scientists expressed the three-layered understanding of illnesses. Ordinary, Serious and leading to fatality. The usual illness can be known by the questions how do you do? What did you do? Was there any modification deliberately done, as one is aware of the approach of illness or recovery. It is the expression of pain / pleasure, avoidance and preference. For both efforts are activated by living beings. A person who is more seriously ill does not cognize, withdrawal / remember, co-ordinate, clearly identify, deployment of sense organs. In such a situation even the ordinary people decide that the illness is serious. The desired pain / pleasure deviation is not quickly expressed. A still serious patient may not express any pain even though stimuli are contacted. He is not in a status to say about cognition, loss of memory, lack of co-ordination etc. He is (breathing) taking in something from environment and throws away something after utilization (exhale  breath out). When carefully examined some contraction relaxation of a very fine pattern is revealed. Nothing else than these if examined, attempt to initiate hope and treatment is recommended. But in the situation where the inhalation  exhalation and fine most contractions (to light in the eye) is not examined; a professional should not initiate treatment. To take a decision whether or not to initiate a treatment; the examination or color, odor, swelling, wrinkles etc. is not useful, but examination of desire for pleasure; disgust for pain by self efforts is very useful. A patient does not express this, does not have correct cognition; memory etc. and if the breathing and showing fine most contractions, one can initiate treatment. The patient responds after a stipulated time. But in the situation where intake, exhalation etc are not seen, starting treatment is a big lapse on the part of the professional. So the Ayurvedic scientist lays primary emphasis on examination of the knower. Confidence that the knower is dwelling in the body is a primary pre-requirement of starting any treatment. If all the three tiers of knowers existence are not examined; not to start or stop the management is absolutely necessary. Ayurvedic S`haareera sthaana chapters, therefore provide abundant explanation of the knower, before the structural details of the body are described. Compared to the vivid structural-dimensional components, non-dimensional Aatmaa is to be understood with more acumen explanations about the various aspects of the Aatmaa are exhaustively given. The system of awareness is similar in a number of species. Naturally it is expressed as one, which partakes in every being. The term Aatmaa spells that one which is dynamic all the while. Calling clearly the examinable Aatmaa as only philosophical and not practical is a conceptual misunderstanding, since it is a fine most, subtle most entity many names are ascribed to it, Sus`hruta having enumerated all possible synonyms; adds  whosoever may be; but Aatmaa is the factor responsible for knowledge. The knowledge about the inside and through sense organs; knowledge about surrounding environment is promptly utilized for possible protection of the beings. Disease, ill health, recovery from illness, evolvement of progeny is the stages where one has to pay attention to Aatmika characters. Knowing has a specific weightage in each situation.

Instead, cognition is done by inferencing knowledge through observation of different Hetu, or factors proving the presence of the objects. This type of knowledge is dependent on previous direct, object cognition. The relation between the Hetu and the object is previously observed and memorized leading to correlate both and inferring the presence of the object without its being directly seen. The process is scientifically elaborated by the oriental sciences. The different terms are defined and explained in detail in order to understand this process easily. These terms will be well understood when explained along with an example. Lets take an example to prove the presence of a fire and a mountain. Saadhya: Is the object whose presence is to be proved e.g. fire Hetu: Is the factor, which is in constant relation with Saadhya the object. Hence leading to confirm the presence of Saadhya without directly bringing into contact the sense organs with the subject i.e. smoke. Pakshya: Is the site where the presence of Saadhya is to be proved. e.g. The Mountain where the presence of fire is to be proved. Sapakshya: Site where the relationship of the Sandhya and the Hetu is assertively confirmed. E.g. the kitchen where smoke and fire are always present. Vipakshya: It is the site where the Saadhya or the object is definitely absent. e.g. the water bodies where fire is never present. Pakshadharma: The Pakshya is the site where the object is to be proved. So the main purpose of the site is that is has the presence of the object. e.g.: The presence of fire on the mountain is the Pakshyadharma or the purpose of the mountain for that period. Vyaapti: The invariable relation between the Hetu and the Saadhya technically termed as the Avinabhava. The status of non-existence if the other one is not present is called Vyaapti. In other words it is defined as the certainty of association of the presence of smoke only in the presence of fire. Concomitance of smoke and fire. To have a flawless inference Vyaapti should be clear. Paraamars`ha: It means knowledge of qualified reason existing on a subject. Thus to know the concomitance of smoke and fire and to also directly cognize the presence of smoke on the mountain, leading to inferring the presence of fire on the mountain. Anumitee: It is the knowledge achieved due to Paraamars`ha. Concomitance is ascertained by the presence of association and absence of variation. But mere concomitance is not sufficient. The presence of the smoke on the mountain is also important. The fire should not be seen along with the smoke on the mountain. If it is seen then the knowledge thus gained will be termed as direct perception instead of inference as the sense organs come in direct contact with the Saadhya or object whose presence has to be proved. Hence for inference one should note that there should be some doubt about the subject to be proved prior to the judgment. To know the concomitance of smoke and fire and to also directly cognize the presence of smoke on the mountain leading to the inference of the presence of fire on the mountain is known as Paraamars`ha. Sad Hetu / Valid reason: Hetu or reason means the symptom or the factor by which, the Saadhya or subject is to be proved. The other synonyms for Hetu are or Sadhan i.e. reason. Sad Hetu means the factors, which lead to the inference of true knowledge. The criteria for calling any symphonic Hetu, Sad Hetu i.e. valid reasons are as follows: I.e. presence of smoke on mountain, I.e. presence of smoke and fire together in kitchen. I.e. absence of smoke on water bodies. I.e. absence of rain in presence of smoke I.e. Presence of smoke along with fire, when seen directly or when climbing the mountain. All this mental exercise of inference and judgment is done for drawing some conclusion. Positive or negative, the Hetu should be true and not fake. Five of the valid reasons have been explained The Hetu described are of 3 types Purely positive Hetu  Kevala Anvaya Hetu Purely negative Hetu  Kevala Vyatireka Hetu Duly positive and negative Hetu After seeing the nine technical terms of Anumaana, we need to understand Vyaapti and Paraamars`ha in detail as knowledge obtained from inference is based on correct knowledge of these two. Vyaapti or Concomitance: It is the invariable relation between the Hetu and the Saadhya, the Avinabhara status of the non-existence of one if the other is not present. Vyaapti therefore is the rule of being together (Sahaacharya Niyatataa  a technically termed) e.g. the invariable concomitance of fire and smoke where there is smoke there is fire invariably. Smoke is pervasive but fire is pervading. That which is wide spread is Vyaapaka or fire and that which is pervaded is Vyaapya or smoke = fire and that which is pervaded is Vyaapya = smoke Wherever there is Vyaapya there always will be Vyaapaka. But the reverse will not be true. Hence it is important to know the differentiation of the Vyaapya and Vyaapaka. The Naiyayikas explain this difference by explaining two types of Vyaapti or concomitance. The Anvaya Vyaapti or the Vyatireka Vyaapti Anvaya Vyaapti  means stating putting forth a statement E.g: Having seen one poisonous snake if one holds each and every snake is poisonous. Then on seeing a non-poisonous snake there will be variation in the Vyaapti of snake = poisonous hence leading to the inference that false knowledge has been gained. Hence to avoid false knowledge, examining the Vyaapti by repeated exposure to the Vyaapya and Vyaapaka relationship has to be done. If any doubts are present in relation to established Vyaapti_s they should be eliminated by a thoughtful evaluation of the facts or Tarka. Keval Anvaya Vyaapti Hetu: This type of Hetu or factor can put forth only positive statements. No negative statement can be stated by this Hetu. E.g. The object of knowledge i.e. Prameya always has a name (Abhidiya). A jar is Prameya; the jar is denotable because of its cognoscibility; here deniability is the Hetu.  We cannot turn this statement into a negative Vyatireka statement by saying that the jar is not denotable because it is not cognizable, it will be a false statement. Keval Vyatireka Hetu: This type of Hetu or factor can state only negative statements. No positive statement can be stated by this Hetu. E.g. the earth element is distinguished from others by its quality of smell. So we can state that, which is not distinguished from another does not possess the quality of smell. Here smell is the Hetu. Anvaya Vyatireka Hetu: This type of Hetu or factor states both positive as well as negative statements. E.g. where there is smoke there is fire present as in a kitchen and wherever there is fire absent, smoke is also absent, as in a lake. Both the positive as well as the negative statements hold true. After knowing the types of Hetu_s we need to see how to derivate and communicate these inferences. For self-derivation of inference known as Svaarthaanumaana, one has to repeatedly observe and draw inferences from previous experiences and in newer and newer situations To communicate the inferences to others a systematic five component method, is prescribed as follows: This is the systematic method of rational submission for any topic. Lets see this with an example. Conclusion: On account of the smoke it is proved that the mountain is fiery. The entire logic is based upon reason. A said Hetu improper reason to begin with should be avoided. Fallacious reason leads to definitely wrong inference and consequently wrong judgments. Wrong or fallacious reasons are those which do not possess even one of the qualities describing valid reason or Sad Hetu. These Hetu areas are known as Hetvaabhaasa. The synonyms of Hetvaabhaasa are Asad Hetu, Dusht`ahetu, Ahetu. They are of five types. Over wide E.g.  Branding of animal as a cow by examining existence of over wide norms. Many other animals have norms without being a cow. So it roves the subject and simultaneously others too. Uncommon Discrepancy  Some one makes a statement that sound is eternal because of its S`habdatva. Here the reason taken is no likely to depend on other Dravya_s like soul etc. they have eternity as the reason, which does not exist on other Dravya_s of eternity nor does it depend on a jar, which is not eternal. So the Hetu is not present on the similar or negative factors, hence it cannot prove anything transitory because it is knowable. Here no similar or contrary instances are present. Since everything is included in the subject, no other item can be similar or contrary. Knowledge or reason for everything transient is inconclusive. Contradictions: It is contradictory to the thing to be proved. It proves the animal is a horse because it has horns. Here having horns is not proved on horses. There is negation of the existence of a horse. The contradictory reason therefore is defective. Now we will see the types of inferences described in Oriental Sciences.

In this type of knowledge the sense organs do not come in direct contact with the object of perception and cognition is done by inferencing knowledge by observation of different Hetu, or factors proving the presence of the objects. But this type of knowledge is dependent on previous direct, object cognition. The relation between the Hetu and the object is previously observed and memorized leading to correlate both and inferring the presence of the object without its being directly seen. This process is scientifically elaborated by the oriental sciences. The different terms are defined and explained in detail in order to understand this process easily. These terms will be well understood when explained along with an example. Lets take an example to prove the presence of a fire and a mountain. Saadhya: Is the object whose presence is to be proved e.g. fire Hetu: Is the factor, which is in constant relation with Saadhya the object. Hence leading to confirm the presence of Saadhya without directly bringing into contact the sense organs with the subject i.e. smoke. Pakshya: Is the site where the presence of Saadhya is to be proved e.g. The Mountain where the presence of fire is to be proved. Sapakshya: Site where the relationship of the Sandhya and the Hetu is assertively confirmed. E.g. the kitchen where smoke and fire are always present. Vipakshya: It is the site where the Saadhya or the object is definitely absent. E.g. the water bodies where fire is never present. Pakshadharma: The Pakshya is the site where the object is to be proved. So the main purpose of the site is that is has the presence of the object. e.g.: The presence of fire on the mountain is the Pakshyadharma or the purpose of the mountain for that period.

Poorvavat Bhavishyakaaleena Future event inference S`heshavat Bhootakaaleen  Post event inference Saamaanyatodrasht`a Vartamaanakaaleena Present event inference According to Charaka, a human essentially expects reasoning with Yukti. In Yukti multiple causes are there. Therefore in a human related to Ayurvedic aspect a single cause is never anticipated. A shortlist of the inferences, which can be made by observation of Hetu is given below: Hetu Inference 1. Digestion of food Type of Agni 2. Capacity of exercise the strength of the body 3. Attachment to worldly pleasure the presence of Raja Dosha 4. The instinct to hurt others  Anger 5. Prayer Faith 6. Cognition Intelligence 7. Arisht`a symptoms Nearness to death 8. Proceeding on the right track Forhonatic period There are many more observations, which lead to correct inference and they are to be done using the right methodology.

It represents a variety of meanings in the social, cultural, philosophical and literary globes such as quality, property, secondary, strands of rope, bowstring, thread, deliberation, merit, sense organ etc. this word has been derived from the root Gun`a which means to invite. It etymology is given as that feature of Dravya by which one gets attracted or invited towards Ayurveda, the Indian science of life. Here the word Gun`a is used in both the philosophical and clinical context. Aachaarya Charaka has defined Gun`a as the inseparable attribute of a Dravya_s responsible for its action; which cannot exhibit any action on its own. He has enumerated 41 Gun`a_s, which are classified into 4 categories Artha_s (objectives of sense organs), Gurvaadi (properties of bodily and outside Dravya_s) Buddhi to Prayatna (characteristics of soul) and Paradi (applied aspects). Although Charaka has described the role of three Gun`a_s Satva, Raajasa and Taamasa in the process of evolution, he has not included them in the list of the above-mentioned 41 Gun`a_s. Aachaarya Vaagbhat`a however has considered them in this list and has termed them as Mahaagun`a_s. Aachaarya Sus`hruta has stressed the practical utility of Gun`a_s and has explained Gun`a along with the actions they are responsible for. Different commentators, including Chakrapaan`i, have also followed the same system of understanding Gun`a_s with the expected karma_s. Thinking on the same lines, Hemaadri is the first person to frame this theory in more appropriate words. He has described Gun`a as potential of Dravya responsible to produce a specific action. In simple language, Gun`a is the potential energy of a Dravya and karma is its execution in the form of kinetic energy. It should be noted here that the Ayurvedic concept of Gun`a is very broad. Along with being responsible for effects, Gun`a_s at times represent physical properties such as weight, appearance, consistency etc. of a Dravya. This aspect of Gun`a needs to be considered equally. In any Dravya, the Gun`a_s get manifested as a collective outcome of the quantity and configuration of the Mahaabhoota_s forming that particular Dravya along with the type of reaction between them (Samsarga Anupraves`ha / Anugraha). It is interesting that not all characteristics of a Mahaabhoota get represented in every Dravya e.g. though Pitta and Ghrita both have Jala as the second major Mahaabhoota, the former expresses Dravatva of Jala, while the latter has Snigdhatva of Jala. When any outside Dravya (Aahaara / Aushadhi) enters the body, it gets metabolized by Agni, which may result into change in the status of its Mahaabhoota and hence, ultimately its Gun`a_s. Number of Gun`a_s: As discussed already the number of Gun`a_s is 41. Out of these 41, the Guravaadi Gun`a_s are more important practically. The number of these Gun`a_s mentioned by Aachaarya_s is the same i.e. 20. These Gun`a_s are described in 10 pairs, each consisting of 2 Gun`a_s. Aachaarya_s have Equi-opinion about 5 of these pairs. These are: Guru Laghu (weight / nature of digestion) S`heeta Ushn`a (temperature / capacity to affect body temperature BMR) Snigdha Rooksha (capacity to produce humidity / dampness) Saandra  Drava (density / viscosity) Pichchhila  Vis`hada  (sliminess / stickiness) However, there is difference in opinion about the following 10 Gun`a_s Charaka Sus`hruta Teekshn`a-Manda Teekshn`a Mrudu (Penetrating power) Kat`hin`a Mrudu X  (Consistency) Sthira Sara Manda-Sara (Velocity) S`hlakshn`a Khara S`hlakshn`a-Karkas`ha (Touch) Sthoola-Sookshma X-Sookshma (Particle size) X Sugandha Durgandha (Odour) X Vyavaayee X Vikaasee X As`hukaaree The points to be noticed from the above description are: Assessment of Gun`a_s: In the Triskandha Ayurveda, Hetu_s are narrated in terms of Gun`a_s. Lakshan`a_s get manifested due to fluctuations in the status of Gun`a_s of bodily elements. Chikitsaa is the administration of Viparita Gun`a_s. Hence, the assessment of Gun`a_s becomes very crucial for precision in Chikitsaa. For assessment of anything, valid, objective and reliable parameters are necessary. In case of Gun`a_s, the parameters need to be developed for both bodily (Lakshan`a_s) and outside body Dravya_s (Hetu, Chikitsaa). These parameters may prove useful to establish Ayurvedic pathological laboratory investigations and to standardize Ayurvedic drugs. The balance of Dosha_s is said to be Arogataa / Prakriti. Though this balance is not the perfect equilibrium of Dosha_s, it is described as normal for a particular individual. This norm can be well assessed with the help of Gun`a_s. Imbalance of Dosha_s is Roga. For perfection in Chikitsaa, it is necessary to understand Ams`haans`ha Kalpana of Dosha_s, which is completely based on Gun`a Taratamataa (+ or gradations of Gun`a_s) Vruddhi of one Dosha may manifest in totally opposite types of Lakshan`a_s due to its vitiation in terms of its Gun`a_s e.g. in case of Vaata Vriddhi. When Vaata gets vitiated due to an increase in the Sheeta Gun`a, it gets manifested as Stambha. However, when Vaata Vriddhi is due to an increase in the Chala Gun`a, Kampa is observed. These two Lakshan`a_s Stambha and Kampa are opposite to each other. This concept is demonstrated in Prameha Nidaana and Kusht`ha Nidaana. As Chikitsaa is the administration of Viparita Gun`a_s, the vitiation of one Dosha in terms of different Gun`a_s will require different drugs accordingly. In the above example, for the treatment of Stambha, Ushn`a Gun`a is required and in case of Kampa drug having Sthira Gun`a must be given. Hence, there is necessity of Dravya Parikshan`a, which will provide Gun`a gradation graphs to facilitate the physician in selection of the appropriate drug of choice. This is the theme of Ekadravya Chikitsaa. Experience with assessment of Gun`a_s: In this direction research work was carried out as part of an MD thesis at Gujarat Ayurveda University, Jamnagar. An attempt was made to evolve some objective parameters for Snigdha and Rooksha Gun`a_s of the Dravya_s outside the body. The following 8 drugs (4 Snigdha and 4 Rooksha) were selected for the study. These drugs were graded for their Snigdhataa and Rookshataa on the basis of available textual references. This graduation was considered as `standard` according to Aaptopdes`ha. Further, various physiochemical (Pratyaksha) and pharmacological experiments with clinical study in healthy volunteers (Anumaana) were planned. The experiments in which the observed values coincided with the standard were considered as useful parameters for assessment of Gun`a_s. Physiochemical experiments: A total of 12 experiments were carried out. Hypothesis regarding each experiment was tabulated in 1. These hypotheses are drawn on the basis of the Jala Mahaabhoota dominance of Snigdha Gun`a and its anabolic nature. The definition of Sneha as per Vais`heshika Dars`hana (the property, which brings the powders in lump form) was also considered)  All the experiments were carried out as per the Indian Pharmacopoeia. Results of these experiments are summarized in tables 2 and 3 NA: Not applicable, as ghee and honey are in liquid form. NA: Not applicable, as ghee and honey are in liquid form. Of these experiments, three experiments Viz. binding capacity test, disintegration time and moisture content, have supported the hypothesis. Hence they are suggested as possible parameters to assess Snigdha and Rooksha Gun`a comparatively. The results of experiments for hardness, ash value and hexane soluble extractive are useful to assess Snigdha and Ruksa Gun`a separately. Some experiments such as micrometric properties and water-soluble extractives have proved useful to assess only Snigdha Gun`a. As the Gun`a_s are defined in terms of their actions, experimental studies were planned on the selected drugs. This experiment was originally developed to assess the effect of test drugs on Agni. As drugs with Snigdha Gun`a are said to increase the Bala, it was thought worth exploring whether this effect is due to improved status of Agni. The test drugs were fed to experimental animals for 10 days in the dose extrapolated from the human dose. The following parameters were evaluated at baseline at the end of the study. As drugs with Snigdha Gun`a are said to increase the Bala, the effect one exercise tolerance was evaluated in the rat model of swimming induced stress using the following parameters Snigdha Gun`a is said to produce Kledana (dampness) and Rooksha Gun`a produces dryness. Hence, it was decided to study effect on the secretions and motility (lubrication of channels by increased secretions) Results: Although there were some changes in all the studied parameters, they were not statistically significant. These results indicate that it may not be possible to use only single or groups of parameters to assess a Gun`a without considering other associated Gun`a_s, season conclusive to expression of Gun`a_s etc. if these factors are considered while designing the study, the parameters employed in Dipana and Paachana experiment and stress induced hypothermia may prove helpful for the purpose Clinical study: The last phase of the work was a clinical study. Out of the selected 8 drugs, only four drugs (2 Snigdha and 2 Rooksha) were administered to healthy volunteers (n=6) for 15 days in A dose of 4.5 grams / day. The volunteers from ghee and Apaamaarga group completed the study course. The summary of effects of these drugs on various parameters is presented in table 4 The following points can be noted from the above table: \u221a  S.Cholesterol is decreased in ghee group, while surprisingly it is increased in Apaamaarga group . \u221a  Total lipids are increased in both groups, which was more in ghee group. \u221a  although there was decrease in total proteins in both groups, it was more in the Apaamaarga group. \u221a  The increase in exercise capacity was more in ghee group. \u221a  The weight increased in the ghee group, whereas decrease in weight was observed in the Apaamaarga group. This single parameter has shown results according to hypothesis, though it could not be of statistical significance. It reveals from the above table that clinical study has not supported the hypothesis As this study was a first attempt to evolve parameters for Gun`a_s; it was difficult task to design the experimental models and understand them in the framework of Ayurvedic concepts. Although some parameters were found useful, the observations made and shortcomings noticed during the study would certainly provide guidelines for further work in this direction. The experiments were carried out only on 8 drugs. For the confirmation of the parameters they should be studied with large number of drugs. A single parameter cannot be employed to assess any Gun`a. A battery of parameters needs to be used, which can collectively assess Gun`a_s. It should be kept in mind that physical property and physiological action may not always represent a single Gun`a e.g. Amla Rasa is S`heeta by touch and Ushn`a by Veerya. A practical example is of a slice of bread, which is heavy to digest but light by weight. In such cases the assessment becomes more difficult. As mentioned in the introductory part of this article, the manifestation of Gun`a_s in any Dravya depends on the configuration of and the type of reaction between the Mahaabhoota_s forming that Dravya along with their quantity. The physiochemical experiments though designed to assess quantity of Mahaabhoota_s could not throw any light on the other two factors. In the pharmacological and clinical studies, evolution of parameter needs identification of the specific feature of that particular Gun`a i.e. one is to one correspondence between a Gun`a and a biological even e.g. Rooksha-S`hosha, Guru Brumhan`a. However, in case of Snigdha Gun`a such events are described in terms of Mrudu and Guru Gun`a while the effect of Rooksha Gun`a is narrated in terms of Kat`hin`a, Laghu and S`heeta etc. The same thing remains true for Amurtimanta Dravya like Kaala e.g. In Grishma Ritu all favorable Gun`a_s for Vaata Parokopa (Laghu, Rooksha) are present still the process of Prakopa gets arrested at the level of Chaya only due to presence of a single potent Ushn`a Gun`a. In spite of being Snigdha effects of Madhura, Amla and Lavan`a Rasa_s on Indriya_s are Prasaadana, Harshan`a Upaghaata respectively due to the presence of other associated Gun`a_s. Rasa-Gun`a: The same thing is observed in case of Dosha_s where Ushn`a and S`heeta Gun`a_s, if accompanied with other group of Gun`a_s execute various Dosha Prakopa Pras`hama patterns. The same thing is shown in the following table: Total effect / action of a Dravya is the net resultant of interactions of all its Gun`a_s. Hence in the elected 8 drugs, though Kut`aja and Apaamaarga, both are Rooksha Dravya_s one is Stambhaka and other is S`hoshaka as their Rooksha Gun`a is associated with S`heeta and Ushn`a Gun`a respectively. Snigdgata of Yastimadhu and Ashvagandhaa may be same but due to allied S`heeta and Ushn`a Gun`a respectively the effect produced by them may vary. Though the concept of Gun`a_s is important clinically, exhaustive studies are necessary to evolve parameters for their assessment. References: Pr. S.k. Ramchandra Rao (ed.)

From outside it may be true, but not so if one seriously considers the reality. The body has arranged the components in two divisions, namely right and left. For simple observation it appears reasonable, but left and right are not similar, in function. The breathing is for pulling the air mixture from outside to reach to the exchanging area of alveoli. By that specific action the useful oxygen is in and the unwanted carbon dioxide along with other gaseous / vapor waste ingredients are out. The entry for this inhalation, exhalation is divided into right and left halves in all animals. It is noted that out of the two routes available, the action is either by right or the left part. There is rhythmic change of route, and this alteration of routes is a regular feature even though the air mixture is inhaled for oxygenation and exhaled for getting rid of waste. Inhalation is the prime initiation of life process to survive. And that exhibits dissimilarity. Extremities are apparently similar, but the reason why the majority of them initiate work with the right hand is not clear. There could have been 50-50% individuals initiating their actions by both the hands. Even though there is insistence on using the right hands, a few do not follow it for total life. So probably insistence to initiate by the right hand, also has no significant reason. As one looks at two (imaginary) halves of the brain, it is noted that centers responsible for control are not located on both the sides. It is either right or left division that rules the activities. The prevalently understood physiology does not give any rationale, behind the fact that the body is functionally full of dissimilarity. Indian sciences related to health maintenance, Ayurveda and related to endowment of existing capacities, yoga; put a reasonable view, they state that the entire globe is comprised of two contributing (opposite) entities, the sun and the moon. Their represented contribution makes the body function in alternative cycles of dominance of either. The right side is dominated by the sun; whereas the left one is dominated by the moon. This contribution enforces the characters in a number of ways. The systems responsible for conversion of solids and liquid intake of the body have their main organs on the right side of the body. This is the result of global dominance of sun. The liver, head of pancreas duodenum are located on the right side. The heart providing benefits of digestion to the total body, by pumping the blood, is located on the left side of the body. The ovaries in a female after maturation release one ovum per cycle for the chance of getting fertilized by sperm. It is stated that the level of hormones namely estrogen and progesterone in serum, is responsible for this periodic release. But how it (programs) releases one from right/left at each cycle, even though the serum level is the same for both, is not put forth. The conception is responsible for the initiation of the formation of the breast milk progressively. But even though the serum levels of hormones are the same; the breast milk is more and earlier in / from one (right / left). Breathing is the initiation of life process and release of matured ovum is the pre-requirement of continuation of progeny. Right, left sides differentiation is noted in both. The alternation of routes of inhalation is something like finer tuning, for homeostasis of metabolism, apparent by modification of body temperature. To compensate undesired high, the alternation of right and left route is programmed. The body achieves finer adjustments to modify homeostasis-disturbing aggregate, existing at that juncture. With the rise of temperature inside or outside, the modification of route to breath by left, instead of right, is done by the body. Equally in other situations to compensate extra cooling, right nostril in place of left is activated. The temperature of the right nostril exhalation is higher as compared to that of the left. All these examples, given in very brief point out the asymmetry than symmetry of right and left sides. This is dominantly examinable at the functional level. The photograph of half side of face, if put by the side after reverting; does not develop to show the face. The Id`aa (left-moon) and Pingalaa (right-sun) terms refer to respective representation of global components in the body. The alternation of inhalation/exhalation, actually executed by the self-primed program is sufficient proof to accept the concept of contribution of opposing components in the body. Ayurvedic and yogic directions to modify, the nostril for breathing, is the method of compensating the excess, existing in the body, by very subtle  most functional tool provided by nature. In an attempt to provide an elective program to couple, desirous to have a particular sex of the child to come, a planned stimulation of right/left side is suggested to partner. This is further extended to stimulation of / at nostril level by systematic psychological and physical, physiological actions anticipated by celestial positions, according to the almanac. The term `Isht`alingaapatya is for the desired sex of child to be conceived. It is equally open for desire of female child, by stimulation of left nostril and for male child by stimulation of right nostril. Later on it turns into a procedure suggested for procurement of male offspring alone, under the popular term Pumsamvan. To crave for a desired sex of child is as old as the first human conception. The distinct functions observed by oriental scientists, have led the concept of desired sex of progeny, for which, by considering possible multiple factors of couple and of the environment; a program is suggested with possible hitches in success. Day by day the so called strange concepts of earlier oriental sciences are supported, anchored by experiments with sophisticated instruments, and there is a trend to suspect that there may be useful wisdom in the guidelines, for the present day needs of an ailing humanity. In the Nagpur veterinary college, academic staff was inclined to test the end result of so controversial a claim, for modulation of sex of child by Pumsamvan procedure in would be pregnant ladies. As veterinarians, they insisted on producing more females, than the averages recorded at their cattle breeding. After discussion, the central Governments Rabbitary, with record of male-females (Dom-sires) naturally born, was chosen. The record for three years showed the incidence of 51-49% m/f ratio, without any stimulus independently applied. In procedure to promote occurrence of male child, instillation of 3 drops of tender leaves folded as a cone, before appearing on twig as separate leaf; rubbed in honey on a rubbing stone, in the right nostril was necessary. Since the intention of seeing the efficacy of the same procedure to promote female offspring was to be evaluated; the left nostril instillation, in the morning for consecutive three days was decided. The records of many details, about the heat in animal, mating, and other components as per routine, were done by veterinary college persons. The instillation in the left nostril was conducted by PG scholar from Govt. Ayurvedic College, Nagpur. After a period of 4 months the incidence of m/f ratio was 36/64% in the treated, in the recorded background of 51/49%. According to the Rabbitary officer, the stimulus was working, as claimed in the ancient texts. Dr. Sathye B. V Sr.Scientist AyuSoft.

By this any lay person or a serious scientist can differentiate things for choice or for rejection. A mango is chosen as suitable, for pickle or for delicious mango juice, by noting its available and anticipated qualities. The requirements at various stages of growth, or beginning and recovery from disease are different, and the selection of proper substances is dependant solely on the subtle most knowledge of properties existing in them. The Ayurvedic term Gun`a stands for attributes properties, qualities etc. The ancient texts incorporate four types of main qualities. By noting them the primary combination of contributors is known, by the sound of the substance, the touch, the color-complexion exhibited, the taste, and smell an individual comes across these as he gets aware of things around. So these properties are considered first. They tell one what proportions of fractions of Mahaabhoota_s have combined in the evolvement of the material. The hollowed architecture of substance can be noted by the sound it makes, whereas dense structure makes a different sound on knocking. When the touch is noted, one is aware of the different impacts the substance has gone through in evolvement. The color-complexion communicates the contacts of converting factors; mainly in the forms of heat, moisture, duration- the color usually changes by contacts with these factors. The taste of a substance is dependant on the contribution  proportion of water fluid components that have taken part in the natural / prepared material. The smell of fine particles communicates the original intact substance, even though the figure of that substance has changed. So the simple sense organs help everyone to be aware of contributions from hollow loose Aakaas`ha (sky) in the substance, skin makes one aware of the impacts that have been borne by that substance  Vaayu. Apparent color tells about the contact of converting factors to which it is exposed, Tejas. Taste informs us about the water content which may be added later on. And smell tells the actual entity from which the fine particle is separated by the decreasing water content that was earlier combined. Living beings require various proportions of the universal Mahaabhoota  fractions and by noting the objects components; particular dominant substance can be chosen by examination by the sense organs. The Arthas (object types) are substance 5; giving the information of contribution of 5 Mahaabhoota_s, by the 5 sense organs. Later on 10 pairs of opposite qualities altogether 20 qualities are described; because the maintenance of health is seen by use of balancing substances of opposing properties. The building of the body components is usually done by using nutritive materials, but as the phase wise requirement is completed, providing the same material furthers the development of the illness. The requirements change during health or in the managements of diseases. So the professional should be alert for opposite, rather than only one directional effects of available range of substances. Nutritive and non-nutritive, depleting effects are wanted for health, in changed situations. So the awareness of opposite pairs is appropriate, rather than the single directional attribute. Thus by the possibilities of requirements, the spectrum of body corporal properties are fully elaborated. The health conscious consumer or patient expresses a lead for what is to be chosen in different situations. When properly interrogated, the information about what is pleasing or troubling is obtained. In situations of approach of illness or in the chances of recovery, worsening, the person can detail the distinct changes that have taken place. These changes may not essentially tally with the usual likes and therefore comforts and dislikes that create discomforts. It costs efforts for achieving pleasure and avoiding pain by the body. Due to this universal phenomenon, the knower related six properties Ichchhaa, desire, Dvesha, hatred, Sukha, pleasure, Duhkha, agony, Prayatna, initiation of efforts for both, and Chetanaa, conscious about all these; are supporting expressions of body protectors to facilitate the association of qualities suitable for that junctures need. By elucidation of these, the professional can guide himself to the proper choice from the available, the closest matching. So the non-material expressions are incorporated in the list of qualities simply because they are related to one, who is going to consume the selected properties material to achieve benefit. When all three tiers of homework of selection are over, it is time to dispense the most proper intervention. To complete this actual task, so many details about the entity with many comparisons are to be comprehended. The ten details ; without which the decided advice cannot reach the consumer, are deliberately listed as properties, as they also really act, if the entire knowledge about Mahaabhautika contribution, the balance achieving capacity of opposing properties, and the matching of expressions of protecting knower of the body, are to be delivered. Paraadi, details are absolutely obligatory. Without their consideration, and proper incorporation (of details), the earlier wisdom is futile. The comparative information about better, or otherwise, the association and otherwise of other therapeutic / auxiliary ingredients, unit measure, frequency of repetition, period for dosage, number of units at a time, process to be opted, specific brand to be chosen, so on and so forth, all these make the reaching of the advice to be more fruitful. It is something like changing business between the cup and the lip. The spectrum of the so labeled Gun`a_s is rightly in line of evolvement, in the work of dispensing, making it favorable to achieve the target of balance of Dosha_s, Dhaatu_s, and Mala_s; by coverage of everything required.

We see very aggressive marketing of everything, everywhere. The industry takes care not to let the customer think about the need of the product he is buying. They generate the most attractive manner. The things considered luxurious once upon a time have become the basic needs of todays life. The stands are full of variety of similar products giving an illusion of buying freedom to the consumer when actually he is being manipulated into the predetermined corner and compelled to buy without even a chance to think. Various lucrative offers dazzling wrappers, carefully targeted audience and unbelievable variety make a combination that is well nigh impossible to resist. The tendency to avoid physical work as far as possible, leads to increased mechanization in life. The common example being battery operated tooth brush, razors etc. the day begins with a toothbrush that is operated by a battery, the person is not ready even to take the minimum effort required to brush his/her own teeth with his/her hands, the person is reluctant to even lather his shave and cut by his manual razor, this leads to a lethargy, lack of exercise which leads to a chain of events culminating into various disease states. Ayurveda believes that most of the disease status result from malfunctioning Agni / digestive fire loosely translated as individual digestive capacity barring a few where external factors like trauma are present. It is not enough to eat proper food but is more important to digest what one has eaten. The chronic indigestion lies at the root of most of the disease states. The properly digested food yields the nutrient fluid Aahaara Rasa that is capable of nourishing the body constituents and thus ensures continuation of life process. If and when the digestion is not complete or improper the result is a highly contaminating and toxic metabolite called Aama. Since it is produced in place of Aahaara Rasa it has access to all the body constituents and thus it results in malnourishment. Depending upon the length of time and severity of malnourishment various complex disease processes manifest in the body. It is absolutely essential that one consume food that is wholesome, at proper time, in adequate amount, in a sequence prescribed and not too fast or too slow. One should refrain from trying out newer things. Experiments with food articles or cuisine should normally be avoided. One should concentrate on food while eating. It is true that a person is what he eats and digests. Junk food is going to make junkyard of life in the long run. Ayurveda has laid great emphasis on food and considered it to be one of three supports of life. Most of us have experienced that quality of food consumed affects us in a sense that the quality and quantity of stool and urine is immediately altered depending upon the food articles consumed in the previous meal. Pungent and spicy substance would cause hyperacidity, piles, pain in the abdomen, ulcers in the mouth, burning Micturation etc. while starchy products may cause either diarrhea or constipation and lot of gas formation. Some substances are wholesome and good for health singly but when combined with other wholesome the result may not be more beneficial but may be contrary. Combination of lime with turmeric gives rise to a red color that was not present in either of the parents. Similarly on combining, the resultant product may exhibit properties that are not good for health. This concept is called as Viruddha Aahaara by Ayurveda. This is a potential source for majority of internal diseases like Herpes (Visarpa), sensory motor disorders like spontaneous loss of vision, hearing etc. Ascites (Jalodara), sexual disorders like low count, motility libido etc. anemia (Paand`u), food poisoning, Swelling (S`hotha), acid peptic disease (Amlapitta), skin diseases (Kushtha), fever (Jvara), common cold and other respiratory afflictions, hereditary / genetic disorders (Santaana Dosha) and finally even premature death. Nowadays it has become a common practice to feed the children cut fruits mixed with milk and is considered healthy as it supplies the most essential proteins and minerals from diet itself, thereby eliminating the need for expensive daily supplements. Consuming fruit that is not ripe or ripened by using chemicals or which is overripe and is going bad is to be strictly avoided. Fruit should be generally chewed instead of consuming juice. Similarly with growing influence of western life style we find practice of sauna followed by ice cold shower on the increase in the higher income group people. These are some examples about advice by Ayurveda of incompatible food combinations, which recently have become an essential part of daily diet due to ignorance. The various factors that render a combination incompatible are as follows: These are some examples, which are commonly encountered in practice by a Vaidya, they are indicative of the magnitude of the incompatibility of food combinations. As seen before, the food yields a nutrient fluid after digestion in the alimentary canal that is further acted upon by the various secondary Agni components of the tissues. If this conversion is adequate then the nutritional status is maintained but if the nutritional fluid suffers quantitatively, qualitatively or functionally then the result is a toxic metabolite called Aama. Depending upon the irregularity of Agni function the intensity of Aama varies as also its extent in the tissues. If it is quantitatively insignificant it tends to accumulate in its harbored tissue till such time that it can flare and cause disease like most of the skin lesions or chronic acid peptic disease, but if it is significant then it can manifest as an attack of grave magnitude and consequence that might result in incapacitation or even death. Since Aama has access to all the paths and constituents of the body it can harbor itself at any one or more of them depending upon the nature of incompatible combination consumed by the person. If the Aama harbors itself to a vital point / Marma like heart, brain the result is disastrous but if it attaches itself to a tissue in a localized manner then the result can be like an abscess that need incision and draining after that it heals without significant residual damage but if is it of an insidious type and is consumed repeatedly over a period of time the result is chronic skin conditions called Kusht`ha. Since the diseases are of occluding nature, the principle of management is first to get rid of the accumulated occluding matter Aama from its harbor. These purifcatory measures are called as Pancha Karma in Ayurveda. They include a three-stage operation in which the body internal environment is prepared to precipitate and liberate the harboring Dosha from its harborer, then the procedure proper of eradicating the vitiated and contaminating Dosha as Vamana / emesis, Virechana / Purging, Basti / medicated enema, Nasya / nasal instillations and Rakta Moksha / blood letting and finally the dietary regimen following the procedure / Samsarjana Krama. Then to strengthen the harboring and vitiated body constituent by improving the Agni function (thus reducing the possibility of Aama formation), to such an extent that it would be able to withstand an assault of similar nature in future this is called as S`hamana or Pallilative measures and finally the rejuvenation aspect called Rasaayana. Sages have advised yearly cyclical Panchakarma as preventive measure and to enhance resistance and maintain a state of positive health and promote a state of equilibrium of all the body constituents. In practice we find lot of persons consuming the incompatible combinations but not suffering to the extent expected. The reasons are as under: - This is true in a sense that incompatibility does not affect in these situations immediately but later in life as the age advances the insidious damage caused by it finally surfaces and the person suffers from various diseases that have obscure etiology. Thus it is in the best interest of everyone to watch for quality, quantity, and attributes of the food that one consumes as to the compatibility of the food with oneself. It may be not very pleasant to say no for a while but it is distinctly unpleasant to suffer from a disease as result of weakness of flesh. All the 18 contexts by which otherwise nourishing food becomes non-nutritive, but cause for triggering / potentiating diseases. Because of avoiding repeatedly consumed loved tasty items by advise of professional, initially reluctantly, has given results, and the significance of the (strange) concept therefore need be considered by every health desirous person. The Sanyog-Viruddha (non-nutritious by being combined together) can be elaborated as the combinations lead to changes in taste, color and solid-liquid homogenous ness within the span of 15 to 30 minutes. This is never observed in traditional cooking. Food intake is for contributing to new tissues or for compensation of wear and tear of tissues. By association of certain aspects this purpose is not served. Here the food items as such are reputed for nutrition by their components. But due to context of other factors, the useful nourishing food is not nutritive. It becomes detrimental to be the cause of disease. To make the professional alert on this aspect, seers have documented a list of diseases, which appears to be irrational for an inexperienced person. But Sus`hruta and Vaagbhat`a incorporate the non-nutritive food by the association of 18 contexts in the class of slow poisons. Charaka initiates this topic by detrimental effect of certain raw and processed items. A professional therefore, should start considering this as the cause of disease, which is not giving relief with usual management. The average patient may tell that he is opting that association for many years. But discontinuing enhances the efficacy of management and therefore the concept has weightage. Food components not carrying the usual nutritive role on one side and damaging the tissues as the effect of poison, make the name-Viruddha; a thing against the expected properties. Following 18 aspects when associated revert the nutritive benefits of usual food intake. 1) Habitat 2) Wrong season 3) Individuals digesting variation 4) Quantity + or 5) Tolerance of the individual 6) The pattern of Vaayu in GIT movement 7) Processing on the raw 8) Moist or dry pattern of consumers alimentary canal 9) Opposing efficacies of combined 10) Phase of digestion when consumed 11) Sequence of items in meal 12) Environment for intake of food 13) Social fellowship while taking food 14) Appropriate nature of cooking 15) Favorite/otherwise items for the individual 16) Nourish able status of items 17) The method of service and cherishing of food 18) Combinations of different items resulting in loss of homogeneity. As an example one of 18 is now illustrated. Many combinations create a very loving taste or flavor. A person seeking change than usual is attracted to it. This crave for the novel cherishing comfort should not sacrifice the very purpose of nutrition. A pleasing entity is not essentially always beneficial. Banana and milk are nutritive and both maintain their homogenous nature for stipulated period. When the two individually nutritive food items are mixed together by crushing bananas the combination quickly exhibits change in appearance, taste, and homogenous nature. With passage of time span of 30-45 minutes the color darkens, taste modifies, and separation of water component from the mix is seen. Ordinarily cooked items stand for longer period without showing any tendency to dissociate. If the prepared food shows separation of earlier homogenized nature one avoids offering such food to guests, family members. The separation of liquid from solid is observed in the body in pathological conditions. The body as such never exhibits this in health or growth. The combination shifting in color, taste, consistency will imbibe the same qualities to the consumer. Therefore substances that change very quickly are not applauded, but categorically disregarded. The curd is also such substance that separates its liquid from solid component. The sprout is a substance wherein transient components are constantly changing. They are not as stable as the original grain or legume. The seeds have a lasting nature but the sprout is in interim phase of changing materials inside. Fruit cut and mixed with milk by combining variation make a range of lovable tastes. But the combine has no stability. The advise of Ayurvedic seers is based upon the progressive expression by the combination in the interest of proper building of tissues; rather than alone comfort of taste and new strange flavor. The food rendered prone for dissociation due to combination is indicated as the slow acting poison, and risk to the cycle of resistant tissues. In present day catering number of such combinations are in vogue, as special of that eating-place. The conscious person can apply the test of stability of characters and nutritive potential and respond to aggressive canvassing in the interest of his tissues. Analyses of ingredients alone or merits of non-combined constituents are not helpful. Avoiding such combinations by patients has totally changed the long experienced resistance to management both Ayurvedic and non-Ayurvedic too. The association of other factors is also evidenced as one proceeds to look in this way. Vaidya Vilas Nanal Sr. Scientist AyuSoft.

Minor in the sense that there is no teaching, learning system available. Still some technologies are in use by the farmer. V.A. literally means Ayurveda of plants that ultimately means sciences dealing with every aspect related to the life of plants. Resource texts: The most popular texts of V.A. are Upavanavinoda of S`haarangadhara and Vrikshaayurveda of Surapaala. Both the texts contain nearly the same material with some deviation. The Upavana Vinoda is a chapter from the anthology Sarngadhara Paddhati The period is 13 th century A.D, Surapaalas Vrikshaayurveda is a manuscript and it stands alone as the work of the author Surapaala. Another major resource text on the subject is Brihat Samhitaa. Though it is not totally devoted to the subject, it covers many areas of V.A. Other texts are Krishi Paraas`hara, Krishi Sookti. Some other texts like Amarakos`ha, Dhanvantaree Nighan`t`u, Bhaavaprakaas`ha Nighan`t`u also cover some part of V.A. Later texts from South India S`hivatatva Ratnaakara have merely copied the verses from Upavana Vinoda. This shows that the subject was not developed after the 14 th century. Topics covered in V.A. the major texts Upavanavinoda and V.A.of Surapaala, cover the following topics: The glory of plants The good and evil omens of plants planted near the house Discussion of soil Classification and morphology of plants The processing of seeds Plantation Watering of plants Safety of plants Method of gardening Detection of water in soil Nurturing of plants Treatment of plant diseases Vichitrikaran`am, novelty possible by efforts on the plants Indicators to predict the generation of Agri products Glory of plants: This topic deals with the importance of planting and it seems that the important subject of planting is convincing through Dharma. Some rituals are discussed. Agnipuraan`a tells us that the cutting of a plant is an offence. Manu exhorts that the cutting is a politico social crime and deserves punishment. Manu has also given the guidelines for the punishment. Good and evil omens: This topic discusses the good and evil omens of planting of trees near the house. Surprisingly the Upavanavinoda and the Surapaala do not provide the logic behind it but some texts like Gobhil Grihyasootra (4/7/21) do attest the omens by certain logic. The Matsya Puraan`a (245/20-22) tells that if the not indicated plants are planted, these should be transferred away from the house; while Brihat Samhitaa tells (53-87) that if not indicated plants are planted, some holy plants like As`hoka, Punnaaga etc should also be planted near them. Types of soil: Here we find the types of soil. There is description of good soil for plants and list of plants generally grown in a particular soil type. The Brihat Samhitaa (53-93) gives two objective parameters to determine good soil as dig a pit in the soil, fill it with water, go away 10 feet and come back. If the water is as it is and has been not absorbed, it is good soil. Another parameter is the weight of 1 Aadhaka soil (volumetric) should be 64 Pala (gravimetric). Ayurveda texts have elaborated the soil types and the plants accordingly but the discussion in Ayurveda and V.A. differs in its basic intention. Hence the two should not be compared as generally done by scholars. Classification of plants: We find classification of plants right from the Vedic times. The Rigveda classifies Ya Phalinirya Aphala Apuspa Yascha Pushpinih. The Ayurvedic texts Charaka Samhitaa, Sus`hruta Samhitaa also classifies plants. The Amarakos`ha and the Manusmriti have classified plants as per their specific needs. Various methods of propagation are also discussed in this topic. These methods include cutting and grafting. Processing of seeds: Here are discussed some processes to be carried out on the seeds before they are shown. They include processing with ghee, honey, and cow dung. Plantation: Which plants should be planted in a particular season, the system of planting etc. is discussed under the topic. Some diagrammatic schemes of plantation are also elaborated. Watering of plants: The scheme of watering of plants according to the season is discussed in this topic. The Upavana Vinoda discusses the indigestion of water. The parameter of indigestion is described as incomplete absorption of water in the pit of plant. Security of plants: Appropriate measures for security of plants, is elaborated in the concerned chapter. It appears that the measures were in use by contemporary farmers. There is also one Mantra to keep away the rodents from plants etc. Garden construction: The method and techniques useful for creation of a garden for public utility is discussed in this topic. This topic interestingly has a technology to purify water. Detection of soil for underground water: This topic elaborates on some plant and animal indicators of the presence of water in that particular soil. It seems that the art of digging wells and ascertaining water with the help of such plant animal indicators had been established in the contemporary culture. Even today some persons ascertain the presence of water using such techniques. Nourishment of plants: Here are some recipes for nourishment of plants. A unique preparation called Kun`apa Jala is mentioned here. Novel techniques of gardening: Here we have some novels methods, which may be rejected at its face value. But it seems that there is ample potential for such experiments. Annadinishpatti: This is very unique topic. Some indicators to predict the production of crop are discussed here. This is also a potential subject for further studies. Some modern works related to Vruks`haayurveda Theory Surpals Vrikshaayurveda is available in printed form. One work is by Dr. Nalini Sadhale in English and another is in German by Rahul Peter Das. Upavana Vinoda translated by G.P. Majumdar in English is an old one while the same edited by S.K.Ramakrishnan Rao is the latest. A Marathi translation done by Vaidya D.B. Borakar is also available. (A critical edition of Upavana Vinoda was prepared for the first time by Vaidya Shriprasad Bawdekar. The work has a proper authentic Marathi translation, the Ayurvedic perceptive on the subject along with critical edition of the text. The work was submitted to the Tilak Maharashtra Vidyapeeth, Pune for an M. Phil. degree. The English translation of this work is in progress.)

In the noon the intensity of the light and temperature is more so it is called as the Pitta Kaala. And the evening is dominant by moving winds, which is called as Vaata Kaala. The function carried out by the wind in the universe is identical and comparable to the Vaata.

Further they have elaborated the means of achieving and consequently of accumulating the knowledge. They are somewhat distinct from those in vogue today. Beginning of efforts for knowledge is by reading the documentations done by earlier generation Earlier generation is definitely well wisher of the progeny. They provide to the later generation experience of them, by narration or documentation. The efforts done by earlier generation to acquire the knowledge of entire surrounding need not be repeated anew by later generation. Simple and extra-talented peoples go on adding and refining the corpus of the wisdom for the benefit of learning younger ones. This is achieved by teaching the necessary skills, with cautious alert guideline for risks in random contacts with environmental entities. As the parents are definitely well wishers, the knowledge transferred by them is beneficial to the learning follower, rather than to the teacher. The initiation of life, due to yet to mature tissues and sense organs, is not capable of independent scrutiny, but follows what is seen around, for a stipulated span in every species. The each and every learning, it is wise, should start with the reference to the documents or narrations available. Having looked through them one can start using his sense organs for awareness of newer or non- mentioned entities. Here the substances, phenomena, observed in nature and in individual are compared for the purpose of explanation of what is happening in (the inside) the body. This method saves time efforts, and inputs otherwise essential for demonstration. In nature things are exhibited consistently, and everybody can observe them constantly. The validation of the association between in-nature to that of in the body is intelligently reconfirmed many times by many curious scientists. Ayurvedic seers, therefore, thought it appropriate to give the guidelines for aspirant learners. The nature is the supreme teacher of all who are desirous to know about any thing or any one. Here by nature or technical term Loka, takes in ambit the entire environment except the studying individual. This teacher is typically friendly to those they exert their intellectual capacity to unfurl the science behind natural phenomena. It is equally enemy to those who go on with laziness, by ignorance and no desire to understand. As the documents available have nothing recorded by earlier observers, a curious should go to the supreme teacher, which is nature. Author Charaka puts it by these two ways, where as Vaagbhat`a states that in all activities (of human health-welfare) the only available worthy teacher is the nature. From this teacher, after individual learning, the curious disciple submits his view to fellow colleagues, for refinement of his expression. These submitted expressions are of three types: Pointing the simple similarity of entity or action in nature to that of one being or taking place in the being. Submission of some essence arising out of such frequent observations, to the scholars for validation and approval/rejection by authority after full consideration of favorable and adverse remarks expressed on the submission. After sufficient scrutiny by numerous scientists, with many aspects of possible scrutiny, the all accepted refined doctrine comes to the fore, and this continues endorsement by all even though rigorous validation is done. The initial exemplification is called Nyaaya as it leads the enhancement of corpus of knowledge. The submission to many is called Vaada as initiates multifaceted discussions, and the process of limited approval / rejection in the scientific circle. The few which find acceptance and prove repeatedly, without exception at any occasion, are named as the end-proved one; Siddhaanta The method of getting knowledge is by: Deploying the sense organs to object proper as frequently as required for complete understanding, and By mind concentration, without attaching sense organs to the object properly. This capacity to accumulate knowledge is dependant on fruitful penance inputs by aspirant scientist. The possibility of knowledge without use of sense organs is a very distinct feature documented by oriental seers. The aspirant student needs to possess the yogic methods of acquiring knowledge. Therefore two terms are used. Dnyaanachakshu_s use brings sense organs deployment dependant knowledge, where as Dhyaanachakshu_s use provides knowledge without contact of sense organs to the object. The corpus of knowledge so achieved is superior as compared to the earlier one. Attentive use of sense organs is possible by all, where as only mind concentration for the topic of study, and no use of sense organs; is possible only by few. Another distinct feature of such refined texts / documents is that the advice by such seers is definitely beneficial to the follower, and there is no direct or hidden gain/interest of the preacher. When Charaka Samhitaa preaches, change your habit and wake-up one and half hours earlier to sunrise time; the follower is sure to harvest benefits of the change in habit. But by no way there is any gain/interest consideration accruing to the credit of original adviser or the present-day preacher of the centuries old advise. Nature provides so many items of so many requirements of all beings, but there is no gain of any one. When one wishes to have more information, it is the nature that teaches and there by the entire animal kingdom is culture for survival. Therefore study of substances is started by saying, that the item is not originally initiated by any individual but, essentially by Mother Nature. So the first noted character of substances is that, they are not initiated by single individual termed technically as Anaadi. Majority of health or disease managing stimuli (substances or processes) are expressed naturally. The professional by their experience streamline the use of all. When a bone fractures, the muscles around contract maximally, comparable to the bone. The application of splints of bamboo, or of similar fiber material is the procedure just in tune of what nature has done immediately to immobilize the fragmented ends to minimize trauma / destruction of important components around. Decreasing the food is naturally initiated by natures dictation. Professionals streamline it by their experience, by distinction of type of Agni, constitution, tissues status, pregnancy / nursing status etc. There are innumerable examples to understand such point. While studying substance it is obligatory to understand the self (natural) expression so to say Svabhaava of the material. The substances by themselves exhibit the potential utility, harmfulness to other substances, plants, animals. Naturally every thing possesses a set of properties, by learning which, professional has to use them. A quickly perishing substance can not be used for making the consumer to have long lasting tissues. Swinteblica fruit naturally exhibits non-decomposing nature, when left as it is. This specific property is observed by students in the teaching by nature. By noting this distinction, choice is made for efficacy to achieve long lasting of body-components. There many similar examples that communicate the selection or rejection of entities. The reliable reproducibility is dependant on repetition of such observed properties, years and centuries. The term Bhaava_Svabhaava-Nityatva is the feature of constancy of properties and substance observed in nature. Since everywhere the study of nature is useful to save many efforts, time and money; Ayurvedic seers lay emphasis on study of environment with context of beneficial and harmful. And there by make the statement that entire environment is the supreme teacher of intelligent curious aspirants of lasting knowledge.  Dr. B.V.Sathye Sr.Scientist AyuSoft.

Oriental sciences however, make a more comprehensive approach that considers non-material components too, along with material ones. Since the number of such essentially required is nine, the term Navadravya meaning the obligatory nine came into existence. It will be scientifically safe to continue the term Dravya here as any attempt to equate it to 1. Element 2. Substances 3. Matter 4. Molecule etc is not suitable to the technical meaning that each term possesses. (In the prevalently understood meaning.) The nine Dravya_s are essential contributors together for each and every living or the nonliving cognizable thing. Without the contribution of all the nine, nothing can be cognized. They are by their technical names; Aakaas`ha, Vaayu, Tejas, Jala, Prithvi, Kaala, Dik, Aatman, and Manas. These are the causes together Kaaran`a, devoid of contribution from them all evolvement is impossible. Related Sootra C.Su.1/48 For the existence of living and non-living, the requirement is provided by contribution from the pool of five mega entities, the knower, the initiation/intention to produce by the mind of someone Manas, a specific stipulated period Kaala and the distinct location Dik. Description: The prevalent contention that to produce anything, only raw material is required is not sufficiently comprehensive. Thus software has come in to existence, is a fact; the apparent diskette or CD is made up of plastic. But in the past the technical efforts by capable technocrats were still done; it was intellectually conceived in the mind of a living being. He with his intention to produce a device by the information technology technique, could go ahead. Had this contribution of a living designers intention to evolve, been absent, the mere pre-existence of a diskette was not at any stage likely to be the software by itself. The idea and raw materials availability alone, cannot, by themselves, result in the device. A suitable location and stipulated periods contribution is absolutely obligatory. Understanding by the oriental method, covers all the components that are genuinely required for the existence of everything. Here the contribution by the five mega entities; in the way of availment of room, action of mobilizing forces for touch, apparent complexion by heat contact, interlinking of particles by/for earlier fluid character, and shape/form by decrease in fluid dominance in that order, is understood. That respectively happens by contribution from Aakaas`ha, Vaayu, Tejas, Jala, Prithvi, the five-mega entities. The statement that nine contribute for evolvement of everything is factual for all. Individual Causative Entities: Aakaas`ha: Aakaas`ha provides room for all to appear, to modify or ultimately to terminate. Because of the relative rare arrangement of Aakaas`ha in between all substances, each one can be distinctly seen / cognized. If this rare arrangement is not there, nothing could have been differentiated distinct from one another. No resistance to enter in or exit out is the specific character of global Aakaas`ha. You may prepare certain walls as boundaries and label that one as the Aakaas`ha of the pot etc. It hides/ covers nothing, and therefore is of Satva dominance. Restricted to ear, the total architecture of components show that hollowness and thinness is given a freehand in the ear. The middle ear is connected to global Aakaas`ha by the Eustachian tube. Whenever rareness is added to any dense arrangement, a specific sound is produced. Restricted to the body, all hollow structures in the body, which provide the entry, process or exit of many substances; are dominated by Aakaas`ha. The lungs, GIT, skull, heart and circulatory tubular complex, all are the main examples. One can extend this, up to the most minute lumen in the cell. Vaayu: The global Vaayu is spread all over and can be known by movement and touch of other things. Vaayu itself is not visible. But trees, clouds etc moved by Vaayu make its existence known.The touch of Vaayu is vibrant; Vaayu is responsible for the intake and exit of substances from the body. Vaayu dominant components of the body are the impulse producers. The hollowness of Aakaas`ha facilitates the impulsive functions of Vaayu. Impulse alone, with no availability of looseness/hollowness, cannot be effective for actual propagations/changes in positions. The skin is relatively dry, spread all over entity. By movement in object of touch, or the skin, the sensation of touch is understood. Tejas: The global Tejas is uninterruptedly functioning by producing heat and causing conversion all the while. The touch of Tejas is hot. It is dominant by its shining colors. Both the eyes have the specific shining material that is the microform of universal Tejas. The bodily Tejas is seen in digestive capacity, seen at skin, and the food tract Jala: Globally Jala appears in a variety. Thus snow, mist, dew and rainwater are responsible for many inter linking. It has a cool touch. The Jala dominant organ in the body is the tongue. The tongue is a special sense organ encircled by secreting glands. All the watery substances in the body are accompanied by the fluid quality of Jala. Without it they cannot circulate. The water around tongue is responsible for taste. The body harbors a variety of fluids in channels, cells, reservoirs etc. the serum, fat, urine, sweat, internal digestive secretions, saliva, are some of the forms of bodily Jala. Prithvi is the entity, full of variety of shapes and hardness patterns. It has a variety of touches and smell. The nose is a relatively stout sense organ located in bony surrounding and having thick secretions compared to all other sense organs. The hard lasting, rigid, shaped components like bones, cartilages, hair, teeth, stools; nails etc are dominated by Prithvi in the body. The natural scheduled, withering away of each and everything, even though provided with nutritive raw material; has motivated the scientists to consider Kaala as the essential contributor. The sun repeats the rhythm of appearance and disappearance very regularly. The rising and setting of the sun everyday gives the cause of existence and maintenance of all living beings. Kaala is an absolute entity even though labels like Monday, March, summer, Chaitra, Ramjaana Uttaraayan`a etc. are given to it, as per convention. By itself it does not expect anything else for its proclamation. The concept of Kaala, as an entity has been accepted because, even with the availability of raw material, and working force; the evolvement actually takes place only after contribution of an essential stipulated period. For the evolvement of so many natural crops the contribution by time is specific and distinct. Even a continued supply of nourishing components, does not assure growth, if the stipulated period is over. For existence or extinction the contribution of time is obligatory, and cannot be disposed off. This entity is nameable; though non-dimensional. Oriental scientists have considered even the non-dimensional contributors, in the comprehensive method of all causative factors, in evolvements. The rhythmic special movement of the sun is responsible for building or depleting of tissues ultimately. Thus Kaala causes generation, regeneration and degeneration by adding, avoiding, separating many factors from each other. The knowledge of anything cannot be sufficient unless its location, in relation to some known point, is described. The entity Dik is direction. The Dik is always essentially told / declared, in relation to one, which is known or established earlier. The description of something needs details about, the things location in relation to a persons location. When the user of this device, looks towards the screen, he can cognize the letters. If this action/instruction to locate ones vision on screen is not there the advantage of existing letters cannot be there. Everythings description is complete, only when information of, above, below, on the right, on the left, to the back or on the front, is added. Devoid of it actual localization is not possible. Dis`haa is more popular than the word Dik alone. It is essentially relative to some one else and is never absolute. East, West, North, South, are relative expressions. Nowhere is there absolute character by examination of which the nomenclature of north-east etc. can be noted. The other attributes of Dis`haa are similar to that of Kaala. The body from childhood to old age undergoes many changes. The expression of pain or pleasure remains the same and it is the only property of knower inside Aatman meaning that one who is continuously on the move. The body is composed of a combination of distinct architecture of different organs etc. and an awareness system independent of material components. By deploying the sense organs the knower inside and outside the body, the Aatman, protects the body, by modifying the choices of environmental entities. The two types of Aatman are Jeevaatmaa limited to a being under observation and Paramaatmaa present in all beings. The number of beings and their characteristics are same. The Knowers association with body can be noted by examination of certain signs on the body when illness approaches, it modifies, the desires or disgusts, and there are efforts to bring into action the transient modifications till the illness prevails. It is common to all. The Paramaatmaa is only one, common and similar to all animals. Manas: Manas are the non-material component of the body like Aatman. The location of Manas is in the heart and head i.e. the central area between two eyebrows. Thus Manas`s activities or modifications can be known by examination of heart. The tools of Manas are the five sense organs. When Manas works without using the tools of sense organs, in that case it reviews the past, compares the present and estimates the future situation. By using its specific capacity to objectify, even without actual material and only by intellect it enjoys drama, poetry etc. the working of Manas is to decide what is beneficial to be followed and what is detrimental for that juncture, to be avoided, after a comprehensive consideration of all. Here Manas need no objects to be perceived by the sense organs. From contact Manas becomes happy or sorrowful. It is the main function of Manas. Since it is responsible for the feeling of pain and pleasure, and their outward expression, the essential components of Manas are Satva, rajas and Tamas. They are very subtle and one dominates in the total body, are the result from it makes the character of a person. From the elaborations and examples given above, one can understand that contribution from all nine is obligatory for the existence / awareness of everything. To really plan for making anything, one should not only take into account the raw materials, but he should have all 9`s availability before his mind. The innumerable cognized entities are from the contribution of the causative nine; the original contributing global entities are not fully comprehended by the capacities of the sense organs. The contributed, however, is cognizable. From Kaaran`a_s non-decipherable due to mega or extremely microforms, the materials around, record able is available for utilization in management of health and disease. The effect contributed from causes, is manageable for a number of purposes; but the causes in total are never manageable by human efforts. Kaarya is manageable but never the Kaaran`a_s.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ba35e92-25c1-4855-a2df-13797ca3ae01": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ba35e92-25c1-4855-a2df-13797ca3ae01", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"tag": "p", "file_path": "/home/dai/rag/data/clean_html/Articles/Siddhaanta/Omnisubstances.htm", "file_name": "Omnisubstances.htm", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 7543, "creation_date": "2024-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-14", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-15", "summary": "Ayurveda, an ancient Indian medical system, emphasizes the significance of three fundamental factors in the evolution of all things: conceptualization (Satva), reorganization (Rajas), and inhibition (Tamas).

Satva-dominant individuals can endure pain and recover through their own thinking, while Rajas-dominant individuals require reassurance and guidance.

These factors may not be of the usual dimensional qualities, but by repeated, non-exceptional refined observations, every component behind evolvement is examined and scrutinized. The page, printed and being read at the present moment, has reached its present stage by certain non-material components. With the availability of (some) paper and command over printing technique, this page was initially contributed by a concept in the mind. Someone capable (author, publisher) conceived in his mind that a page communicating evolvement of all can be prepared. When this idea initially came in the mind there was nothing. But the idea, conceptualization is the first contribution in making a page available. The capacity to reorganize available material and process it is consequent contribution. Out of the available paper, then a particular, specific size is chosen for the layout of the text. This may have initial conceptualization about a number of minor component details. When the activity of thinking and rearrangement was stopped further, by inhibitions to other alternatives; the design for the page could actually be executed. Conceptualisation (without material proper) is the first important contribution. Reorganization or rearrangement of materials and processes on available material is possible after initial conceptualisation. This conceptualisation is with many alternatives. The alternatives on the conceptual and material process fronts need to be restricted, frozen, inhibited, for actual manufacturing. Eastern scientists state that evolvement of anything requires conceptualisation (Satva) and reorganization according to capacity (Rajas) and inhibition (Tamas) to other alternatives in conceptualisation and reorganization. If the process of alternatives in conceptualisation and process etc continues the conceived entity cannot come into existence. Satva, Rajas, Tamas are the three contributing factors that are absolutely necessary. This applies to a pin as also to metro complex entities. Living beings possess a curiosity to know their surroundings. They make efforts to facilitate the curiosity. Reading this page e.g. is started by the reader out of curiosity. So he has taken efforts to have the book and flip the page to the desired contents. After reading for a while appearance, of ignorance dominates. Then efforts to replace the book in a cupboard are ahead. For curiosity or inhibition; some efforts are necessary. This is seen in all beings, at all time and in all places. Considering this non-exceptional all pervading observation in all times and in all place; oriental scientists state that behaviour modification is due to different proportions of (contributed) Satva, Rajas, Tamas. They have been given a special term existing in every Parama-Padaartha_s. It can be described as omni-substances. The definition is as follows  Anything that is understood, and has made significant contribution to idea-concept, re-arrangement and inhibition to alternatives earlier, is present everywhere. In Ayurvedic profession, it is the expression of pain / pleasure that carries significance. If the expression of pain / pleasure is more, less, not comprehended properly, the decision to estimate pain will be full of errors. Persons by their specific nature of mind; do not outwardly express pain to avoid trouble to others, even though they know the severity of the pain. Some persons express pain very loudly even though the pain is slight. To some persons another person has to remind them that the situation is painful and he should seek a remedy from a professional. Rich or poor, literate or illiterate, persons exhibit distinct class specific characteristics. Less expressed pain, is more serious and deserves intensive professional attention for recovery. Understood, but expressed by augmentation to catch attention deserves, a discount and ordinary management is sufficient even though loud waiting is there. Not understanding the surrounding or inside situation; and therefore grumbling with ignorance and apprehension, a persons management is more difficult even though skilful professionals and high-tec material is at command. Skilful elicitation of distinct dominance of Satva, Rajas, Tamas is necessary for success in a profession. Satva-dominant is always curious about the relation between cause and effect. Rajas dominant is after enjoyment all the while, till hindered by illness. He is not keen on knowing the cause of ill health but needs reassurance and actual strict do and donts. The Tamas dominant person has to be given orientation about prevalent status and forcefully taken to persons or centres of treatment. He is afraid of everything around and does not rely on anyones advice. He keeps on counterchecking the advice given by one, with other. He does not, of his own, proceed firmly to follow any treatment given after consultation. The reason for calling Satva, Rajas, Tamas as existing in evolvement of all, is well spread. The reaction of any stimulus is different according to dominance of these substances. Even though dissimilar in every aspect to each either; they are in a specific combination present in every individual. Contrary entities contribute to the formation of the body. Equally the Manas is also composed to combination of dissimilar fine substances; available everywhere, every time, in everybody. No material component of specific qualities is responsible for the range or patterns of behaviour. Satva dominant individual can bear the pain situation and recovers from a calamity by his own thinking powers. The Rajas dominant will express more both for pain and pleasure and even though initially destabilized can build his recovery when assured by some one with confidence. Tamas dominant however does not get stabilized in calamity (situation) even though, there are many to reassure him. They are vulnerable to calamitous stimuli and succumb to apprehension of everything. The Medical profession, by being aware of this dominance in different persons can suitably tailor the line of treatment. And by doing so the bad prognosis can be a little modified. In equal sufferings situations, the recovery by Satva, Rajas, Tamas dominant patients is with different prognosis. Satva, dominance enhances recovery even in serious status, whereas Tamas dominance aggrevates even in a relatively trivial situation. The communication of events, need to be restricted, so as to affect less the Rajas, Tamas dominant persons. Even news of happiness can be over understood by Rajas dominant person to result in disease. Examination of Manas dominance by Satva, Rajas, Tamas is very significant in actual management. Maternal, paternal, components conscience, Manas with divine and demon characters when properly associated together the development of the foetus actually starts. Maternal, paternal component are examinable, but conscience, Manas shades and qualities from God & demons is visible only to those possessing distinct endowed capacity.

These ideas have been put forth by      oriental philosophy. They are the tools, which help us gain true      knowledge. Just as to understand the formula of Einstein E=mc 2 ,      we need to know the basic principles of physics in the same manner      to understand or gain true knowledge, the Pramaan`as have      been explained  The word Pramaan`a      literally means to measure. This measurement can be done by      instruments other than the body. Hence, Charakaachaarya has      used the word Pareekshaa, which specifies the cognition of      true knowledge only by the means of Indriya or senses.  The      different synonyms of Pramaan`a_s are Upalabdhi, Saadhana,      Dnyaana, Pareekshaa.  The three      technical terms in relation to Pramaan`a need to be      understood to understand Pramaan`a in a better manner.   Pramaa:      (knowledge as it is)  It is the      experience of correct knowledge. To gain Pramaa the state of      the mind must be clear, free from doubts, errors, and indecisiveness.      It must be a suitably cultivated mind in which the scientific      attitude is inculcated, and which is unprejudiced, stocked with      knowledge and full of confidence and faith.   Prameya:      (Knowledge about substrates)  The subject      to be cognized is known as Prameya. The subject of cognition      by means of Pramaan`a is known as Prameya. All      the objects existing in this world are Prameya. Hence the      number of Prameya is countless. Anything that exists is the      subject of cognition. Hence it is known as Prameya. According      to Nyaayadars`hana there are 12 different Prameyas.  The Trigun`a      Tridosha, Saptadhaatu, Panchamahaabhoota,      Rogamaarga are all Prameya_s.   Pramaataa:      (The      desirous individual for real knowledge) The person      gaining the knowledge of the Prameya is known as the Pramaataa,      individual making efforts for real knowledge:  The knower      is the Pramaataa Only true      knowledge is termed, as Pramaa, false knowledge or experience      is known as Apramaa.  Pramaatas      efforts      are of three types  Sanshaya:      The presence of different possibilities on a single subject, which is      to be proved. E.g. to doubt a far off figure in the dark to be, a man      or a pole.  Viparyaya:      False      knowledge is known as Viparyaya e.g. to mistake the presence      of the shiny layer as silver on a seashell.  Tarka:      Purposefully done false claim is known as Tarka e.g. In spite      of having the knowledge that wherever there is smoke the presence of Agni      is undoubtedly true, say that wherever fire is absent smoke is      also absent.   Importance      of Pramaan`a:  The      principles and Padaartha expounded by Ayurveda have to      be proved by Pramaan`a by avoiding chance to mistakes. The aim of recollection of Ayurveda was to maintain the health      and help cure disease. This recollection was done by Maanasa      Pratyaksha Pramaan`a Before commencing any treatment a thorough knowledge of the science      is mandatory to achieve success. This knowledge can be obtained only      by knowledge and use of Pramaan`a The specific knowledge of the disease or the condition of the patient      can only be achieved with the help of Pramaan`a We will now      see different types of Pramaan`a accepted by      different Daarshanika_s.  1.

It not only deals with the disease curing process but also lays great emphasis upon the maintenance of positive health of a normal healthy person. Man has eternally endeavored to keep himself free from three types of miseries, namely physical, mental and spiritual. Therefore the history of medicine is as old as the history of mankind. According to the Indian tradition, the four primary objectives of human life are Dharma  to perform religious rites, Artha  to acquire wealth, Kaama  to satisfy the worldly desire and Moksha  to attain salvation. Good health was considered to be the sine-qua-non for the achievement of these objectives. It will be seen from the definition of Ayurveda as Science of Life that Ayurveda lays emphasis upon leading a life, which is full of happiness, which implies an individualistic attitude, and leading a life, which will be useful to the society as a whole. Social medicine which is treated as a new concept in the modern systems of medicine is nothing but reminiscent of what has been preached and propounded in Ayurveda more than 2500 years ago. Ayurveda is divided into the following branches: According to some scholars Panchakarma Chikitsaa is also a branch of Ayurveda. Ayurvedic science developed around these eight specialized branches but there are no watertight compartments. Before considering the fundamental principles of Ayurveda, it is important to see the different philosophical thoughts of India under which all sciences including Ayurveda are centered. There were six Dars`hana_s on which all the ancient Indian Sciences such as Ayurveda, Astrology, Astronomy, Architecture, and Grammar were based. For example physical and chemical activities take the help of Nyaaya and Vais`heshika Dars`hana_s according to Ayurveda. To explain the process of the creation of the universe and that of man, Ayurveda depends on Saankhya Dars`hana. According to Ayurveda, the universe is composed of 25 elements. The first important fundamental principle of Ayurveda is the Pancha-Mahaabhoot  Theory. A man has five senses through these sense, he perceives the external world in five different ways. The sense organs are five, eyes, skin, ears, tongue and nose. Through these sense organs, the external object is perceived and absorbed in the human body in the form of energy. These five senses are the basis on which the entire universe is classified in five different ways; and they are known as Pancha Mahaabhoota_s. They are named as Aakaas`ha, Vaayu, Agni, Jala & Prithvi. Ordinary water does not contain the Jala Mahaabhoota element alone; but it is composed of all the Pancha Mahaabhoota_s. The elements devised by modern science are many, but in Ayurveda they can be classified into five categories of Mahaabhoota_s. According to Ayurveda the body of an individual is composed of the five Mahaabhoota_s. Similarly other things of the world are also composed of five Mahaabhoota_s. In the human body these five Mahaabhoota_s are explained in terms of Dosha, Dhaatu and Mala and with reference to drugs, they are represented in terms of Rasa, Gun`a, Veerya and Vipaaka. In the normal body of a living being these substances remain in a particular proportion. If due to some reason the equilibrium is disturbed, the body tries to restore it by itself; by eliminating some of the Mahaabhoota_s, which are in excess; or take in some which are in shortage. This shortage of Mahaabhoota_s is replenished through the ingredients of food, drink, air, water etc. The exogenous Pancha Mahaabhoota_s are converted into endogenous Mahaabhoota_s through the process of digestion and metabolism. During the process of death the role of Mahaabhoota is important. The Mahaabhoota have gross and subtle forms. The five categories of subtle Bhoota_s inside the body impregnate the five senses and thereafter they get detached from these five senses and death occurs. The dead body loses the five senses and is composed therefore only of the five Mahaabhoota_s. According to Ayurveda, the human body is composed of three fundamental elements; called Dosha, Dhaatu & Mala. Dosha governs the Physico-chemical and physiological activities of the body. The Dhaatu_s enter into the formation of the basic structure of the body cells; thereby performing some specific actions Mala are substances, which are partly utilized in the body and partly excreted, in a modified form after performing their physiological functions. These three elements are said to be in a dynamic equilibrium with each other for maintenance of health. Any imbalance of their relative preponderance in the body results in disease and decay. The three Dosha_s are Vaayu, Pitta and Kapha and they are composed or Mahaabhoota_s. All the Dosha_s have all five Mahaabhoota_s in their composition. However Vaayu Dosha is dominated by Aakaas`ha Mahaabhoota. In Pitta, Agni Mahaabhoota is predominant and Kapha has Jala and Prithvi Mahaabhoota_s in predominance. The Dosha_s are most important for health as well as for treatment. When they are in their normal state they sustain the body and any disturbance in their equilibrium results in disease and decay. These three Dosha_s pervade all over the body, however there are some elements or organs of the body in which they are primarily located e.g. intestines and bones are the primary seat of Vaayu; blood and stomach are the primary seat of Pitta and thorax and joints are the primary seat of Kapha. Each of these three Dosha_s are divided into five types. These five divisions represent only five different aspects of the same Dosha and they are not five different entities in the body. Vaayu: Is responsible for all locomotive functions in the body such as propulsion of food, urine, Faeces, semen etc., and respiration, speech. Pitta: Is responsible for most of the transformation (Paachana) processes, digestion, conversion of external substances into bio-substances, blood formation, vision, memory etc, are the functions of Pitta Kapha: Moistens food, which helps in digestion, perception of taste, nourishment of sense organs, energy etc. are dependent on Kapha. During different seasons of the year these Dosha_s undergo certain changes, which cause ill health. To maintain health precautionary measures can be taken. Certain procedures can be adopted to promote positive health. Concept of Sapta Dhaatu_s: The basic tissue elements of the body are known as Dhaatu_s. Dhaatu is that which assists the body or which enters into the formation of the basic structures of the body as a whole. These are 7 in number  Rasa, Rakta, Maamsa, Asthi, Meda, Majjaa and S`hukra. (Sperms in males and ovum in females). These seven Dhaatu_s are composed of the five Mahaabhoota_s. Prithvi Mahaabhoota is predominant in Maamsa and Meda Dhaatu; Jala Mahaabhoota is predominant in Rasa and Rakta Dhaatu. The hemoglobin part of blood is mainly composed by Teja Mahaabhoota. The bone (Asthi) is composed of Prithvi Mahaabhoota and the marrow inside the bones, is produced by Aakaas`ha Mahaabhoota. It is true in case of Dhaatu_s also that, all Dhaatu_s are composed of all the five Mahaabhoota_s but there is always the dominating Mahaabhoota. These Dhaatu_s are the seats, which are affected by Dosha_s. So as long as the Dhaatu_s are in a state of equilibrium health remains. Dhaatu_s are the first targets attacked by the Dosha_s. Dhaatu_s are the principle constituents in the disease process (Pathogenesis). Digestion and metabolism: Food, which, comes from the external world into the body, is to be broken up, absorbed and assimilated. A heterogeneous substance has to be made homogeneous. The factors responsible for these activities in the body are known as Agni_s. They represent various types of enzymes in the gastro-internal track; in the liver and in the tissue cells themselves. When the Dosha_s are in equilibrium, the Agni_s function normally. Impaired Dosha_s lead to impaired functions of the Agnis. The concept of Agni, which refers to the manifold functions ascribed to Pitta is comprehensive. It includes chemical agencies responsible for Aahaara Paachana in the Kosht`ha corresponding to gastro  intestinal digestion, which leads to separation of Saarabhaaga. (Nutrient fraction) of the Aahaara from Kit`t`ahbhaaga (undigested residue of the food) and metabolic events to energy synthesis. In addition it Comprehens photo and chemosynthetic processes. Paachaka Pitta is also known as Jaat`haraagni, Kosht`haagni, Antaraagni, Paachakaagni and Dehaagni. It is located in its own place in an area between Aamaas`haya and Pakvaas`haya which, directly participates in the digestion of food and at the same time, lends support to and augments the functioning of the remaining Pitta_s present elsewhere in the body. Paachakaagni also contributes to the seven Dhaatvagni_s and Bhootaagni_s. Jaat`haraagni is responsible for digestion. The food ingredients comprise of six tastes namely sweet, sour, saline, pungent, bitter and astringent. They undergo different types of changes through the gastro-intestinal digestion and the food ingredients are broken into their smallest possible particles, so that they are made absorbable through Villi, gastric and intestinal Mucosa. Mahaabhootaagni are five in number. They help the transformation of the external heterogeneous Mahaabhoota_s into internal homogeneous ones. Dhaatvagni_s or enzymes are located in the tissue elements of the body. They help in the assimilation and transformation of the nutrient material received after Bhootaagnipaaka into substances homologous to tissue elements. During the processes of assimilation through the help of these Agni_s certain waste products such as phlegm, bile, excreta from ear, eyes, mouth etc are produced. Ayurveda lays a great deal of emphasis on all these Agni_s and hence Agni is treated as synonymous with the physical body. Before starting the treatment of any disease, the defects in thee Agni_s are located and efforts are made to correct them. Most medicines used in Ayurveda contain substances, which stimulate the functioning of these Agni_s. During the transformation process of Dhaatu_s; Dhaatvagni_s play an important role. From the nutrient material of the previous Dhaatu three ingredients are formed by action of Dhaatvagni: Next a very important fundamental principle is Prakriti. Ayurveda basically considers every individual as unique. Ayurveda treats the individual and not the disease from this angle Prakriti is very important. Dosha_s namely Vaayu, Pitta and Kapha pervade all over the body. They regulate the functions of each and every tissue cell and they are present in each and every one of them. When the sperm and the ovum unite in the uterus of the mother to form a zygote, the doshas present in and outside produce certain features which are known as Prakriti. The Dosha_s present in them and outside produce features in all the Dosha_s are in a state of equilibrium, then it gives zygote. If certain rise to a healthy Foetus and the child born, leads a very healthy life. If the Dosha_s are very much in a disturbed state, then it either prevents conception or does not allow the zygote to grow or results in malformation. If however one or two of these Dosha_s are moderately in excess, they give rise to a peculiar type of physical constitution and psychic temperament of the individual who is born with it. These characteristic features of the body and mind remain with the individual throughout his life. It never changes. Primarily Prakriti is of seven types: For Ayurvedic treatment, knowledge of Prakriti is very important. A person of Vaata Prakriti is very, much likely to get Vaatika type of diseases. In him diseases of other types do not give much trouble and are easily curable. To prevent the occurrence of diseases, the individual having Vaata Prakriti, should always avoid such of the factors as would aggravate Vaata and must resort to Vaata alleviating food, drinks and regimens. Similarly while administering medicines, other things being equal, a Pitta Prakriti patient is to be given cooling medicines and Kapha Prakriti patient heat increasing medicines. While determining Prakriti the mind is also given importance. The Prakriti_s are said to be Saatvika, Raajas and Taamas. The concept of mind in Ayurveda is important. Ayurveda considers diseases as both physical and mental. In both categories the mind plays an important role in causing the disease. Psychic factors exercise control over the physiological functions of the body and vice-versa. Therefore, even for the treatment of some physical diseases certain psychic measures are prescribed in Ayurveda. Perception of any sensation is dependent upon mind (Maanas). Mind is also called as Antkaran`a, Chitta, Buddhi etc. The mind is said to be located both in the heart and the brain. Like other things in the Ayurveda universe, a drug is composed of 5 Mahaabhoota_s. The Bhautika composition of drugs is ascertained by a physical examination as well as taste. Kapha is dominated by Prithvi and Jala Mahaabhoota. If a disease is caused by aggravation of Kapha Dosha then the individual should be given drugs, which have less of Prithvi and Jala Mahaabhoota. There are many other factors, other than Mahaabhoota theory, which are taken into consideration while selecting a drug. They are attributes (Gun`a), the potency (Veerya), the taste that comes out after the material is digested (Vipaaka) and the specific action (Prabhaava). All these factors inside the drug are mostly interconnected and interdependent, because they represent, different aspects of Mahaabhoota_s of which the drug is composed. Rasa or taste: - Rasa or taste is ascertained by tongue and also by the effect of the drug and diet, on the body of an individual. Rasa are six in number  sweet, sour, saline, pungent, bitter, astringent. Sweet and saline taste increase Kapha and reduce Vaata, bitter, pungent and astringent increase Vaata and reduce Kapha. Pungent, sour and saline taste increases Pitta, sweet bitter and astringent tastes reduce Pitta. In drugs there are 10 pairs of Gun`a_s (attributes). These attributes are both physical and pharmacological in nature. Effects of Gun`a_s supersede the effects of Rasa in a drug. In a drug many Gun`a_s are in existence. But the most active Gun`a, which helps in curing and preventing the disease, is called as Veerya. There are 2 varieties of Veerya. During the course of digestion, ingredients of the drug and food undergo three different stages of changes because of enzyme reaction. These stages are called as Avasthaapaaka. Products of Avasthaapaaka undergo further change because of enzyme reaction in tissue cells. These carry three tastes sweet, sour or pungent; these after tastes are called as Vipaaka. Some drugs act on the basis of their tastes, some on the basis of their attributes, some on the basis of their potency, and some on the basis of their Vipaaka. Actions of some drugs do not belong to any of these categories. They have specific actions to cure diseases, which cannot be explained on the basis of taste etc. This specific action is called as Prabhaava. Two drugs may be similar in Rasa, Gun`a, Veerya, Vipaaka but their action might vary from one another because of Prabhaava. Dr.V.V.Doiphode H.O.D.

It is that type of perception of knowledge, where the science explained in the texts is accepted as Pramaan`a. And Pramaan`a as we have already seen is the right means of the cognition of the truth. We can understand it in terms of the equation E=mc 2 explained by Einstein and which is universally accepted. We do not go on proving it or testing it again and again because it has already been done. The physiology explained by Guyton or the anatomy explained by Gray is universally accepted. In the same manner in Ayurveda the textual quotations from Charaka, Sus`hruta and Vaagbhat`a etc. are means of cognition of the truth. They have collected their knowledge by rigorous studies and passed it on to us for the gain of mankind. The principles or drugs explained by them are accepted by all Ayurvedic physicians and are slowly but surely being universally accepted after being put through clinical research trials. The text of science is refined and described by such scholars who have the balanced tendency not to favor or to go against, due to capability developed, any body. Temporary favor or disfavoring moods never dominate in their minds, (Rajas, Tamas). Hence they support only the knowledge for the welfare of all. They can cognize everything of all the past the future and the present. These scholars are true and honorable and specially know best due their efforts of successful penance and strong desire of welfare of mankind; and no favor to non-worthy. The words of these scholars should be considered as the ultimate truth. Also due to the above qualities we can realize that the research presented by commercial firms usually have vested interest in presenting their research. They ensure that the benefits remain with them and not the public The Aapta scientist advises in such a manner where the follower is definitely benefited and the preacher or adviser is not benefited. When Charaka says green gram is beneficial more than the rest of the grams, he does not owe any manufacturing/trading in green grams. But he is keen on helping others in having a better life. In fact, Charakaachaarya advises that the follower should first go through all possible available works, Dnyaanasamudaaya, and after gaining knowledge, he should try to see it by means of direct perception and draw inferences accordingly and treat the patients. Aaptopdes`ha is the specialty of the oriental development of the corpus of knowledge. Ayurveda has also maintained that one should examine the science S`haastra on the following criteria One that is chosen for study by successful and respected dignitaries in the society. Sufficiently comprehensive in canvas. Honorably respected by members who deserve to be regarded as Aapta Which can be understood by intelligent average and less than average student Without repetition of in statements Propagated initially by the Rishi_s Appropriately arranged with texts, commentaries and compilation for study The actual test should have interest creating verbatim Should be self with self-support and reason Words of the texts should be easy to pronounce and verifiable Must have proper sequence of topic and chapters With decisive conclusions and guidelines for followers The theme meaning should not clash in different chapters Easy intellectually stimulating With definitions and examples. S`haastra is therefore a dynamically processed and evolving corpus of knowledge. The Orientals have started efforts quite ahead of others. They have reached a stage where more modifications in postulates or inferences extended to them were not necessary. But one should note that this stage has come after thousands of years of pursuit of knowledge. As the tradition of documentation was very rich due to a rigorous academic timber, all who contributed, the later generations have the first choice to procure knowledge in the form of finding authentic documents. This referring saved ample duplication of effort and time. Therefore thought, self, direct examination and inferences were elaborately dealt with as a means of cognition; the measure of documents was also equal or a superior means of cognition. In self-direct perception or inference the efforts of only one scientist was required. But in documents it was the synoptic report of centuries and generation efforts by high grade, dedicated, non-biased, yoga enhanced authorities in the field. So the quotation for references from authentic documents found first place in the pursuit of knowledge. These documents were made of very concise nature where only the last conclusion and advice extended on that conclusion was verbally and with the help of manuscripts carried further. The details were ignored for, considering the size somewhere this might lead to fumbling in the perception of the principle by some who might conceive it wrongly and who were not well trained to cognize it. For those, well trained to cognize the documents or S`haastra_s i.e. science passed on through so many centuries, were advised that knowledge pursuits should start with Aaptavachana. Aaptavachana gave the knowledge about the elusive factors of the disease i.e. the type of disease, the Dosha responsible for the disease, the pattern of aggravations of the disease, the patterns of pain, the patterns of relapse of the disease etc. After accumulating this knowledge one should continue the pursuit of knowledge by direct perception and inference if possible and necessary. The means of cognition is S`habda. The health science to be utilized should be examined according to its merits and used according to its context of practice. The compendia form the nucleus material. They have improved in corpus and branches as more reliable knowledge was available, the subsequent authors kept the authorship undisturbed because the main theme was respected. So the compendia though modified to the required extent by contribution enjoys the continuity of name, Charaka, Sus`hruta, Kaas`hyapa etc. The method of expression of the compendia was too compact and due to essentials of poetic construction the arrangements of the plain sentences were also changed. Hence the original text was commented on for elaboration. These commentaries help a lot in decoding the most compact texts.

V M.Sc; Ph.D The source wise classification leads to understanding about the time and efforts of digesting capacity, required to utilize the member of the substances than each class. Audbhida of vegetable / plant origin, is relatively easy to get digested in shortest time. Comparatively Jamghama, substances from animal origin are easy to digest if they are of liquid nature. If substances of animal origin are more and more compact in architecture, they are difficult to ingest and digest. They take a longer time and effort for utilization by beings. The classified Paarthiva_s are really dense in architecture and contain the least water component. Therefore they are to be subjected to batteries of processes whereby their heterogeneous character is modified and made suitable for various ingestion etc. Out of shaped entities those having some water component, are easier for intake. Common salt is basically a substance from Paarthiva or mineral category. But compared to other minerals it is easily used up, by the body because it has the suitable water component. The origin of this mineral is from a global water reservoir, the sea. The metals of mineral origin, the biological entities of animal origin, available after cutting, open the body of the animal, are relatively difficult, as compared to biological substance like milk, for acceptance by the body. Plants products that emerge for the most, by breaking open the ground from below are substantially easy to be homogeneously accepted by beings. This classification is also for pointing out the difference in the lasting characters observed in the members of three classes: Paarthiva or Mineral From animals All herbs The Paarthiva_s-minerals, exhibit a long lasting quality in general. The plants as a whole perish quickly, except the hard structured barks, central core, & seeds. Water / moisture rich in components is prone to decompose and lose its utility as a nourishing food item. The biological entities obtained without cutting the body are easy for acceptance, quick in replenishing, but they do not show a long-lasting nature. Biological substances obtained after cutting open the living-killed body shows a little longer lasting pattern. The materials from the long lasting groups if suitably processed can enhance the tissues capacities, by preventing or deferring the decomposition, putrefaction process observed in beings. The shape retaining minerals when capably processed, endow the usual body tissue building. Plant material, however, is basic material as all animals are dependent on it. If grass, weeds, is not available to the initial range of animals; the so-called higher hierarchical animals cannot survive. The source wise classification therefore, is dependent on many aspects of decision. All such substances when they reach inside the body, their behavior is different. Therefore after utility prone classification, scientists have given the patterns of behavior of the inside of the body. Out of the innumerable materials, some (try to) pacify the Dosha, some prefer to disturb the usual functions of Dhaatu_s-tissues, and some contribute to the routine health maintenance; whereby it can be stated that there are three varieties of actions of intake in the body. The reference is as follows: C.Su.1/67 It is the experience of all that spices, medicines, make one aware of the substance consumed earlier, by a specific (usually unwanted bitter) taste in the mouth, the next day. But the rice, chapatti (unleavened bread), consumption does not make one aware of the taste next day. If over cooked rice, or burnt wheat preparation is deliberately consumed, even though rejected by the tongue; it does not reappear in mouth, or does not produce the sensation that the body has received something for the maintenance of tissues. It sticks on the inside of digestive track and disturbs the function of the track. If by accident or deliberate intention, poisonous material reaches the inside of the body, the body attempts to throw it out instantaneously. Such substances on contact, disturb immediately the body tissues or organs. The usual food items do not initiate any such reaction. This clearly shows that behavior of entrants is different. Considering this difference in destiny of intake, all entities Dravya together are classified into three types: Doshapras`hamana possessing antagonizing effect on vitiated Dosha_s towards pacification. Dhaatupradooshan`a type even though not akin to tissues, it continues to cling on them and consequently, hampers the routine tissue function, progressively for the most, but at times abruptly. Svasthavrittimata type after-assimilation in the body gets homogenized with tissues, and therefore this type is useful for everyday health maintenance. The term Svasthavritti means health maintenance, the end part Mata means one that is approved for maintenance of positive health. From three types elaborated above, one can guess that they stand for firstly therapeutic material, secondly poisonous or tissue harmful intake / contact, and thirdly usual nourishing food range respectively. These effects of substances are after the initial taste dependant on the main Dosha antagonizing activity. It is dependant on many components together rather than the taste of the substance alone. The actions due to taste are more apparent, as compared to these three types. This classification is based on the total effects of entities, noted by three observations. They are: Conversion, absorption, and homogenization with existing tissues, by compensation of wear and tear, or addition of tissue units. Entry inside the body and re-excretion through Dosha channels to leave the body after the work is over. Entry inside the body even though primarily rejected, and continuation of stay in tissues without homogenization with them. This decreases the strength of tissues as the unsuitable substance is forcibly occupying place. This materializes due to certain specific components existing in that substance. This according to commentator is Dravya Prabhaava. Here Dosha denotes the vitiated Dos`ha as well as Rasaadi Dhaatu. Thus Doshapras`hamana pacifies vitiated Dosha_s and Dhaatu_s also, as the first attack of vitiated Dosha_s is on Dhaatu_s. Such substances reappear in track along with the usual Dosha appearance. Medicines enter in, do the desired correcting action and leave the tissue zone as by themselves, as they are not akin to tissues. Since the corrective action is followed by getting along with Dosha_s away from tissues, they are most beneficial to the body. The Dhaatupradooshana substances do not leave the tissues and perpetually disturb their structure and function. They are to be avoided in management and professional should be on guard for this type of substances. Here Dhaatu implies Dosha_s in normal state (Sama/equilibrium), and Rasaadi Dhaatu_s and Mala_s too, as in healthy individual, all play an equal role in maintaining normalcy. So the substance or entity, which vitiates any of these components, is referred to as Dhaatupradooshan`a e.g. Visha i.e. poison, vitiates Dosha_s as well as Dhaatu_s and Mala_s, by all varieties of vitiations mild, moderate, sever etc. The beneficial food items, after ingestion, digestion, absorption, enter in the tissue and contribute to their progression not leaving or disturbing them in any event. They are named as really approved for health progress. Repeated continuity of this is responsible for, an individual having normal state of Dosha, Agni, Dhaatu_s as well as Mala with their properties and functions (suitable to his Prakriti) along with pleased / calm / tranquil state of Aatman (soul), Indriya (senses) and Manas (mind). The substances which maintain the state of equilibrium (Svaasthya) are called as Svasthavrittikara / Svasthavrittimata. E.g. usual rice (Rakta S`haali) . It is also useful for pacifying Dosha_s and used in therapeutics for the same. But still its prominent function is to maintain health and hence it is called, Svasthavrittimata instead of Doshapras`hamana. The description that, some are of this particularity is after the observation that there are entities possessing multiple roles. Classification however, is by noting the dominance as elsewhere. Maricha (black piper) is a material that pacifies Kapha and increases Pitta hence can come under both the categories viz. Doshapras`hamana and Dhaatupradooshan`a. But pacification of Kapha and increase of Pitta are functions devoted to Rasa, the dominant component. Hence Kinchit word is used to avoid inclusion of Dravya of one category to the other as single Dravya acts in multidimensional way. An individual can be aware of type on intake. If after 10 -12 hours the taste of a substance is experienced without intake, note that the previous intake was rich in Doshapras`hamana group rather than Svasthavrittimata group. The special occasion celebration dishes are prepared by adding more spice rich components. The next day if one pays attention to the taste in the mouth, it is realized that, even without intake in the morning the previous intakes taste is noted. This is due to more of reappearing components than simply entering in nutritive food items. Vices that have fate of disturbing or weakening tissues (tobacco, alcohol) are initially rejected by the body while they are entering in; they have to be given step by step, for acceptance. Except fine chemicals natural Dhaatupradooshan`a items are not welcomed by the scrutiny machinery at the mouth and nose entry point. The sense organs are programmed to welcome the Svasthavrittimata entities. Dr. Sathye B. V Sr.Scientist AyuSoft.

Any building needs pillars for its stability. The Sanskrit term for a pillar is Sthambha. Ayurveda states that for the proper maintenance of health one needs to have three Sthambhas (i.e. pillars) as well as three Upasthambhas (supporting pillars) functioning properly. The word Trayopastambha derived from Traya means three and the word Upastambha means supporting pillars. The three Sthambha_s are the three Dosha_s Vaata, Pitta and Kapha. The three Upastanbha_s are Aahaara (Food), Nidraa (Sleep), and Bhramacharya (Celibacy) i.e. regulated sexual conduct. In this chapter, the three Upastanbha_s are outlined the role of these factors in mental health. 1) Aahaara (Food):- The Role of Food Vaata is responsible for all the movements in the body. This it does by its nature of being in a state of perpetual motion. Pitta is responsible for digestion, assimilation of food, various sensory impulses, etc. This is done by its Ushn`a (hot), and Teekshn`a (sharp, intense) attributes. Their combined activity results in depletion of body constituents such as Kapha (bonding material, matrix), Rasa, Mamsa, Meda, Majja, S`hukra and Ojas. They have to be replenished or the body would degenerate and succumb to either disease or death. The body is composed mainly of Panchmahaabhoota and the replenishment has to be compatible with what is lost. This is done effectively by Anna / Aahaara (food).When various ingredients of the body are depleted this give rise to specific effects. For example when Rasa Dhaatu is depleted, it causes a craving for something cold and liquid like sugarcane juice, soft drinks etc. these body signals if paid heed to and fulfilled can combat the loss effectively and bring back the depleted state to normalcy, thereby establishing a state of optimum function. How to eat a Meal? While describing the sequence and method of consumption of food, it is advised that sweet food, which has a pleasing, satisfying effect on all the sense organs and mind, should be consumed first. This makes it possible for the person to concentrate on the food before him. Later, sour and salty food should be consumed which are responsible for imparting taste to food articles, palliation of Vaata and secretion of Kapha and Pitta thereby rendering the food liquid. Finally pungent, bitter and astringent foods are consumed. These being dry, light in nature, and not very agreeable to the body and mind keep the Kapha and Pitta under control. This sequence ensures digestion of food and the proper production of Aahaara rasa i.e. proper products of digestion. Ajeern`a or indigestion in itself is the basic cause for a multitude of diseases both physical and mental. The food replenishes various attributes which are depleted during the actions taking place throughout the day. Food and the Three Gun`as The three Gun`a_s have a great effect on the mind. In fact they constitute as it were the substance of which the mind is made. In Ayurveda, a lot of importance is given to the diet for a practitioner of Yoga or religious rituals since the effect of food on the mind has been noted. Foods can influence the mind by increasing any of the three Gun`a_s. A few examples are given below: Food substances that are Guru i.e. heavy to digest increase Tamas and may make one sleepy. These may be useful in therapy. For example, for those who suffer from insomnia, one of the suggestions is to drink Buffalos milk at night. Buffalos milk is known to be Nidraakara or sleep inducing. It increases Tamas. Certain foods increase Raajas like hot and spicy foods and stimulants such as coffee. People, who want to stay awake late at night past their normal sleeping, time usually drink coffee or tea. Conversely others avoid coffee or tea in the evening since it affects their sleep. Certain food substances are known to increase the Saatvika quality, for example Cows milk, ghee, puffed rice etc. Saatvika foods are those that increase the of lifespan, given strength, health, are juicy and pleasing. Examples of Saatvika food are milk, butter, fresh ripe fruits. Raajasika foods are bitter, sour, saline, excessively hot, dry or burning. Examples of Raajasika food are fish, eggs, onions, garlic. Taamasika foods are those that are stale, tasteless, putrid, rotten and impure. Intoxicants like Gaanjaa, stale food, half-cooked food and rotten food are considered Tamasika. Balance of Gun`a_s needed. Our S`haastra_s state that the function of three qualities in their proper place is what is needed for normal existence. Without Raajas we cannot perform various actions that require effort, energy and movement. Similarly, Taamas is required for us to rest and go to sleep or to station ourselves at a given place at rest. Individuals under the influence of an excess of Raajas, find it difficult to rest, relax or to go to sleep. The Saankhya School describes the combined function of the three Dosha_s by providing an analogy with the burning of an earthen oil lamp. The flame, which is light, moving upward and shedding brightness, represents Sattva. The oil, which is the fuel, represents Raajas providing energy. The lamp, which is an earthen container and holds the other two in place and position, represents Tamas. It is the proper juxtaposition and combination of all the three qualities that is needed for the normal functioning of the mind. Food and Mental Health According to Ayurveda, the food ingested is transformed to three categories after digestion, namely Sthoola (gross), Sookshma (subtle) and Mala (waste product). The Sthoola (gross) part nourishes the body tissue (dhatu) and the Sookshma (subtle part) nourishes the mind while the Mala_s (waste products) are excreted. Thus, the mind is influenced by the food taken. While describing the nutritional properties of various foods, Ayurveda texts use several terms pertaining to the impact at the mental level. Some of these terms are described below with examples. Dietary guidelines of Ayurveda, as we can see are based on a proper understanding, of the above listed properties. Items such as ghee are indicated for daily use. Items like buffalos milk are used therapeutically for insomnia. Uses of items like betel nut, wine etc are properly regulated. Incompatible Foods Ayurveda has a unique concept that certain foods are incompatible and should not be taken together. The constituents of the pair may be individually harmless or even wholesome, but as a pair they can cause diseases both physical and mental. There are eighteen types of incompatibility described. Of them, the more common examples are consumption of milk and fruit together, taking something, cold like a glass of water before having a cup of tea / coffee, not following the particular regimen advised for a particular disease, consuming milk and fish together, unripe or over ripe fruit etc. these cause accumulation of Dosha_s in the body but not their outward movement. Hence, their effect may be felt over a period of time even if not manifest immediately. Similarly, they contaminate Rasa and other Dhaatu_s to give rise to diseases like fever, acidity, swelling, herpes, impotence, Unmaada Apasmaara etc. Hence we find great emphasis laid on avoiding the consumption of incompatible foods. Nidraa( Sleep):- The second factor helpful to replenish depleted body constituents is sleep. The body is continuously being bombarded by various sensory stimuli, which have to be accepted, analyzed, acted upon stored in memory for further use etc. This results in the fatigue of the sensory motor apparatus. This fatigue results in inability to perceive their respective stimuli. The bonds between sensory organs and the mind by Praan`a Vaayu, Udaana Vaayu, Vyaana Vaayu, Saadhaka Pitta, Tarpaka Kapha and Rasa Dhaatu get depleted. This leads to a state in which mind, retracts itself, known as sleep. This total retraction of mind helps the body to replenish the vitality of the body and depleted functional capacity of the mind. The depth of sleep is directly proportional to the retraction of the mind. When the Dosha_s are vitiated, they are circulating in the body, through the medium of rasa. Hence, though the mind is retracted from external stimuli it remains agitated resulting in dreams. Dreams have been associated with various physical as well as mental diseases. Therefore adequate amount of sound and deep sleep ensures happiness, nourishment, power, virility and acuity of knowledge. Similarly, lack of sleep is responsible for misery, wasting of body tissues, weakness, lack of libido and lack of concentration. Ayurveda has classified sleep according to the effect it brings about. Normal night sleep is nourishing, replenishing the lost potential of the body senses mind complex Abnormal sleep patterns arise out of: 1) Heightened Kapha activity 2) Disease processes 3) A disease that becomes terminal, non-curable, fatal 4) Heighened Tamas activity 5) Paapa sambhava (caused due to sin) Adequate sleep taken at the proper time is responsible for vigour, knowledge, tolerance, valor, good digestive power, happiness, good physique etc. Untimely and inadequate sleep makes one unhappy, timid, ignorant, weak, impotent, emaciated etc. Brahmacharya (Celibacy): To see the importance of Brahmacharya or regulated sexual conduct we need to begin with an understanding of S`hukra or semen, and how Ayurveda understands its formation. The human body requires food in substantial amounts to sustain itself. This food is processed at three levels (i) Jaat`haraagni (gross conversion from solid to fluid state) (ii) Panchamahaabhootaagni (the fluid is subjected to further digestion to convert it into the Panchabhautika components) and the (iii) Dhaatvaagni (the tissue metabolism). The Dhaatvaagni finally takes the fluid and converts it into a subtle form, which can: a) Replenish its own tissue b) Form the nutrient part of the next Dhaatu or Ojas c) Form the waste material and d) Form the Upadhaatu_s (subsidiary tissues) This elaborate and complex procedure is spread over a period of one month, finally culminating into a substance of an unctuous, sweet, dense, heavy, cold, slimy nature of body constituent called S`hukra. It differs from other body tissues it can procreate. Hence it is close to the soul. Charaka has said the transcending soul and mind use S`hukra as a vehicle. Since S`hukra is a very potent, structurally complex and dense tissue and is derived from the ingested food in a very condensed, concentrated form, its loss can have far reaching effects on the body. Since all the Mahaabhoota_s are participating, it can be stimulated by any of the sense organs as well as the mind. Therefore, all ancient Indian Sciences have laid great emphasis on preservation of S`hukra. This process is known as Brahmacharya (observation of celibacy). The regenerative capacity of S`hukra is utilized for the formation and growth of various body constituents until the person attains maturity. On reaching maturity when the tissues have become stable enough to perform their normal functions, S`hukra starts functioning as a reproductive tissue. Therefore till the attainment of physical maturity, sexual act is prohibited which in males is between 20-25 years and in females between 12-16 years. Depending on various parameters such as individual constitution, dietary habits, season of the year, the frequency of coitus has been recommended. Importance is also given to regular use f appropriate aphrodisiacs. This is helpful to replenish the ejaculated S`hukra. Thus S`hukra being a vehicle of Atman and mind and a major contributor of Ojas, Brahmacharya (celibacy) has been rightly described as the third of the triad. Thus, in short, proper food replenishes the Bhautika constituents, sleep is helpful to soothe the mind and sensory motor apparatus and observance of celibacy or moderation in sex is responsible for spiritual well being.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ca4a026-3865-4a15-83c4-8d85b818a770": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ca4a026-3865-4a15-83c4-8d85b818a770", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"tag": "p", "file_path": "/home/dai/rag/data/clean_html/Articles/Siddhaanta/Yoga.htm", "file_name": "Yoga.htm", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 15872, "creation_date": "2024-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-14", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-15", "summary": "Yoga procedures emphasize the well-being of the hollow organs in the body rather than focusing on muscular exertion.

V M.Sc; Ph.D The total yoga procedure have certain distinct characteristics from other patterns of exercise. The usual working in many trades and skilled professions, including sports, involve the contractions and relaxations in muscular tissue; that are located mainly in both extremities. The weight training, dumb bells, springs are meant for exertion on various groups of muscles, which are related anatomically to the upper and the lower extremities. Sudden, abrupt, forceful contractions, with forceful fast, and deep breathing also accompany in this pattern of exercise. The actions are carried out by quick bends and stretches. Heavy perspiration and warmth of extremity-musculature is appreciated. It is the musculature in general, and extremity-musculature in particular, put to drastic exertion. This is true in case of athlete training, sports or even of heavy manual work. The yogic procedures, however, have more emphasis, not on musculature, but on the clean and elastic hollow organs of the body. Unless the Lumina are appropriately irrigated with water (or Dhautee procedure requires swallowing of 22  ft cotton cloth strip and then it is gradually pulled out thoroughly, gradually; is the pre-requirement of yoga-procedures) is not complete. The Shat`kriyaa concept is meant to care of Lumina and its cleanliness, rather than the capacity of muscles to contract. It will be interesting to establish a correlation with the S`haareera concept. The total body is divided into three zones, according to architectural differentiation. The zones need not be in proximity to each other. The four extremities together are distinct, in architecture, by not possessing and accommodating the hollow structures, except the supply channels. The head and neck portion has certain hollow, structures. But still it is fully and densely packed in tissues. The body can therefore be understood to possess three architecturally different zones. One is full of tissues with minimum channels (Four extremities) other is full of hollow organs and their openings (chest and abdomen); while the third is in-between the two (head and neck region). The weight training, dumb-bell, springs, wrestling, boxing or the usual duties, exert much more on musculature of extremities. They do not press twist and pull the zone of the body, which has many hollow organs. Another medically important point is that the health is dependent mainly on smooth working of organs in the trunk-zone. The limbs in extremity-zone can be spared or cut off. Work or exercise or sports are associated with quick change of positions. The yoga-postures, however, have a sustained bend, pull, twist, on the vertebral column. According to Ayurvedic understanding the bone component is the focus of Vaata Dosha. The vertebral column is poised to sustain still-action in many postures. Thus the hollow organ area is stimulated on one side, and the Vaata Dosha focus is put to activity without putting pressure upon the musculature. Not exerting upon the musculature, therefore, does not require faster oxygenation or quicker replenishment of blood, by quick heartbeats. Here the systems that are taxed physiologically are spared and in addition the otherwise not activated zones in the body are activated. This helps for easier elimination of waste products, better secretion of digestive organs and active cleansing of internal layers of organs, responsible for digestion. Stretching of vertebral column activates the Majjaadhaatu, inside without exhausting it. It acts upon Vaata Dosha and makes for better health. It should be noted here that Ayurvedic intention of controlling Vaata Dosha endows the body with many factors directly leading to the recovery of the patient. The five eliminative procedures, such as therapeutic emesis, selective purgation, (Vamana Virechana), the administration of medicinal warm oils in areas susceptible, sensitive, to absorption, (Basti), shunting out tissue obstructing substances from vascular zone, (Rakta Moksha), or draining the Para nasal zone with medicine and stimulation of the portal of the head or (Nasya)  are all dependent upon appropriate mobilization of Vaata Dosha. Unless the propulsive Vaata Dosha is activated, none of the above-mentioned procedures can be conductible. So the therapy meant for elimination, is mainly addressed to Vaata Dosha first and consequently to the other two. The concept of the progressive propagation of Dosha_s to create various stages of disease (Kriyaakaala) is also suggestive of the active role of the force of propagation. Thus out of the propagation force by Vaata Dosha, the rest of the substances can be disseminated. Postures in Yoga are therefore multi-pronged means to enable the regulation of Vaata Dosha. Another feature of the postures etc.is the slow, prolonged, and conscious rhythmic breathing that accompanies it. Such type of breathing while bending, pressing, twisting, has an impact on particular organs of the trunk area, causing a squeeze and release, rhythm on them. The hollow organs in the area, by this rhythmic squeeze and release, get rid of unwanted particles stuck to the walls. These facets need to be considered in the light of the common treatment of Vaata Dosha. The regulation suggested for Vaata Dosha indicate that there should be tightening of strips causing kneading  like impact on the internal organs (Bandhana-Unmardana, Gaad`hapattairnibadhneeyaat). Efforts should be made to bend and flex the body (Vinaamayet). The encompassing of the organs can be effective measure on Vaata Dosha (Vesht`ana). The postures etc. maintained after proper, prolonged teaching contributes to all the requirements of restoring the balance of Vaata Dosha. In Yoga, the bends, flexions, overextensions cause the kneading  like movement over the internal organs. The various turns cause the body torque. The locking of the thighs is as effective as tight bandaging, but without bandages e.g. Padma, Vajra and Svastika. The Bandhana, Peed`ana, Unmardana, Gaad`hapatta-Nibandhana, Vinaamana; all directed by various Ayurvedic authorities, as components of management of Vaata are effected by various yoga procedures and with minimum exhaustion. Stretching of vertebral column and pressure of bulk muscles of thighs and legs; acts upon the very foci of the Vaata Dosha. The capacity to take in is the beginning of the release of activities of other propagation forces in the body. The Praan`a of Ayurveda is described as one responsible for the wear and tear of existing tissues. If the intake of food, water, air, is limited, the resultant work load on others is also minimized and as such control of intake is tissue-conservative, to a particular extent. The Yogic procedures are better performed when the previous intake of food is digested. To achieve this easily digestible nourishing food must be taken in moderate quantities. The sustained body poising in particular bend, press, pull posture imparts on the body organs, coiling, encircling, kneading, encompassing etc. By this, the Vaata Dosha helps the organs to get rid of pathogenic substances. The capacity to perform postures, without pain indicates that the digestion is somewhat proper. The mental training, for control of intake spells for control of mind. The control of desires for many objects, by itself is a broad-spectrum preventive method. As the intake is reduced to a desired level, there are minimum chances of being in contact with harmful substance. The human weaknesses lead to many contacts with disease provocative agents. The vices, with their many facets, are known for centuries together. But their contact cannot be avoided, due to the unrestricted desires of the mind. The training of controlling intake creates a self  accepted ban on wrong desires and the chances of health maintenance are much increased. The control of Vaayu as advised by yoga is achievable through rigorous training, step by step. As a common measure against all diseases, controlling of Vaayu, according to Ayurveda is also essential. The Vihaarachikitsaa therefore in the form of yoga-procedures helps the subject in many ways. The effect of tissue conservation, ultimately leads to delayed geriatric changes. Physical exercise can be classified into two. One meant for exertion or related to solid tissues of the body. Another is meant for the welfare of the hollow organs or Lumina of the body (Kosht`ha). Where greater movements of the extremities are involved, it is of an exertive type for solid tissues. Where the trunk portion is bent, hyper-extended, twisted gradually and that pose is maintained with elongated conscious rhythmic breathing, this is the exercise to help the functioning of organs, rather than supporting structural tissues. When disease strikes the functioning organs, defects are to be corrected first. Yogic procedures are, therefore, better to activate organs and avoid exertion of supportive extremities. The two types therefore can conveniently be Labelled as supportive-tissue-exercises with contraction; and hollow organ exercise with relaxation and conservation of strength. The four factors meant for controlling a disease are palliative measures, eliminative procedures, modification of food intake and proper Behaviour or Vihaarachikitsaa. Out of these four factors control of Behaviour for promotion of health and immunity from disease, can be achieved by the less exertive group. The exertive group on the other hand is going to tax the tissues and it is not advisable in many diseases. Ancient yogic texts discuss Vaayu as the product arising out of the loss of tissues.  This Vaayu is termed as Praan`a. The capacity to exert for intake, can manifest itself only when the present  existing tissues are consumed in part. Praan`aayaama is elongation of this process of consumption. The yogic-texts explanation of Vaayu itself guides one as which one out of the two exercises mentioned in the preceding paragraph is to be chosen for conservation of health by all for a long period. The Physician Charaka distinguishes between desired and non-desired exertions. In the desired one he includes specific sports etc. In the non-desired he records only one example I.e. lifting the luggage. The luggage is a thing not desired, but has to be completed. It is not desired, because it has the potential of propagating Dosha to tissues and can cause diseases. The Yoga-procedures when they become a part of everyday routine can cause certain effects on the mind. The person spares some minute everyday in trying to concentrate. He goes on reviewing good and bad deeds, and develops further proneness to socially beneficial schemes. He accepts that restrictions are meant for promotion of health. By such an attitude, he can adhere to a particular food diet and develops real hatred for harmful food etc. that is going to lead to disease. Repeated training to minimize extroverted demands creates a totally different attitude, which is very helpful for total management of disease. He thinks about the effect and previous cause; and this makes him adhere to prescribed food, drug and Behaviour. He trains his mind to avoid craving for particular food etc. and this helps him and the professional person in a long-term follow-up to control disease. The person so trained, can be conditioned to ignore the sensation. Concentration on rhythmic breathing makes the pain severity, much less than otherwise. This period of transient less pain decreases his agony and he develops the method for cutting down the severity of pain. This pain reduction is without any tissue benumbing or harmful drug. This has much significance as the control of pain is done without harming the body. The commentators on Yoga-Sootra specify that disease is one of the major factors responsible in hindering the self progress. To avoid dominance of disease, over the body an individual should encourage the study of concentration of mind. The cause for disease according to yoga-texts and Ayurvedic texts is the over dominance of Rajas and Taamas qualities in the mind. This stage can ultimately lead to wrong contact, which causes disease. If one is careful to elicit the proper history of an individual, he will find that, somewhere, sometimes the disease contact is out of a lapse by the individual. Avoiding this is a difficult task to be achieved. The avoidance, however difficult, can bear the fruit of health. Yoga-science is one of the means to prevent disease. Disease is one of the hindrances in selfendowments. This hindrance can be overcome by yoga. The means for it is repeated persuasion of yoga on the one side and progressive asceticism (self denial) for material things on the other. This Abhyaasavairaagya component to control disease or to achieve tissue endowment is important. The active participation of the patient requires both these. To reject the substance that is forbidden, by the professional person, by ones own mind; requires some training of (Vairaagya) asceticism (non-craving). A patient can do well if he develops to substances that are forbidden. Praanaayaama reduces the diffusion of desires. Various postures make the body channels proper for the correct propagation of Vaayu. They reduce the laxness. This also causes stimulation of certain Dosha-Sthaana. Thus the Dosha located on the tissue side, finds its way out to Lumina. This in sequence leads to an elimination of Dosha either through emesis or purgation. Even excess movement of flatus is observed in some patients. Thus the Dosha propagated to (Kosht`ha) Lumina relieve the tissues of the pathogeneses. This happens by proper activation of controlling nearly the Vaata channels. Bandha helps the tissues at the location to separate the Dosha. The Jaalandhara separates sticky Kapha in the Kapha  region. Ud`d`iyaana separates Pitta, Moola-Bandha acts upon the absorption of food and elimination of excreta and Vaata. The varieties of Praanaayaama_s regularize the excessive Dosha; Sooryabhedana-Vaata, Seetkaaree, Seetalee-Pitta and Ujjaayi-Kapha. Bhasrikaa by its continuous action on foci of three Dosha, reduces the excessive three Dosha_s. Thus it will be seen that Ayurvedic Vihaarachikitsaa can be effectively adapted by Dosha-wise and disease-specific yogic procedures. The effect on ultimate regularization of Vaayu, leads to action on other Dosha, and Dhaatu_s etc. Many of the rhythmic breathing procedures are responsible for correcting the digestive capacity. Bhastrikaa breathing was specifically useful in activating Agni in-patient resistant for many years. The scientist Shaarngadhara says that regular breathing is related to proper function of Agni. This was actually observed in many patients. Regularization of Vaayu was dependent on proper Agni where as the regulated Agni was responsible for controlling Vaayu. Both of them are inter-related. The Agni created in yogic procedures is responsible for appropriate intake in the body by Vaayu. Hat`hapradeepikaa in Vol.2/70 has elaborated this concept. Flexing, bending postures, Ud`d`iyaana, Agnisaara were all responsible for activating Agni, as they had their location near the navel. Thus the total Vihaarachikitsaa through Yogic procedures contributes to Dosha annihilation, Dhaatu-conservation, easier elimination of Mala_s to achieve balance, better capacity of Agni better psychological attitude towards life or the diseased state.

Chi. 20/3, A.H.U.2 Introduction: The diseases occurring from the time from birth to 16 years (as Baala is defined as that period of time between birth and sixteen years of age) are called as Baalaroga. They are slightly different from diseases of adults and need special attention and treatment. There are number of diseases which can affect the children and which have line of treatment similar to those of adults with some restriction in use of dosage forms and therapies. Precautions: The treatment of diseases in children should be done similar to adults but the medicines should be mild. Dose of the medicine should be small (Kaneeyasee Maatraa) as children are delicate (Sukumaara Alpakaaya) and eat small quantity (amount and food items) of food (Sarva Anna Anupasevana). Basti should be replaced by Virechana and Mars`ha Nasya should be replaced by Pratimars`ha Nasya in Panchakarma Saadhya Diseases. In Ksheeraada and Ksheeraannaada Baalaka i.e., In breast fed children before weaning, the medicine is applied to the nipple and areola of the nursing mother before each feed. Vis `hesha Chikitsaa: Gudakut`t`a - It is also known as Ahipootanaa, Maatrikaa Dosha, Prisht`aaru as well as Anaamika. It requires a two fold treatment as follows: Ajagallikaa - It is type of Kshudra Roga seen in children. It is a type of pustule caused by vitiated Vaata and Kapha Dosha. Apasmaara, Unmaada: These are similar to those seen in adults. Vaagbhat`a has given Laakshaadi Taila for their treatment in children. Baala S`hosha - it is caused by the blockade in the Srotas by vitiated Kapha. Baala Chhardi -There is some difference between infantsand children. In children it is similar to those seen in adults. In infants thebaby vomits every time after consuming milk (Peetam Peetam Vamati). Note:- Ativishaa alone is the best medicine for Kaasa (cough), Chhardi (vomiting) and Jvara (fever) in children. Dantodbhedaja Baala Roga - Eruption of teeth (the process of developing and teething) is one of the foremost reasons for a number of diseases in children. These can vary from Jvara, Kaasa, Pratis`hyaaya, Atisaara, Visarpa to diseases of eye like Abhishyanda and Pothakee. S`hoola-it is mainly due to consumption of vitiated breastmilk or incompatible food. It can manifest asHrits`hoola, Basti S`hoola, Guhya S`hoola, S`hirah S`hoolaetc. Ifit is due to vitiated milk following treatment should be done. Ksheeraalasaka: It is disease caused by breast milk vitiated by all the three Dosha. It is a serious disease and needs special attention and quick effective treatment to both the child as well as the mother. Even after this treatment if the disease remains unresolved, then it should be treated according to present complaints examining all the factors including Kaala (Vyaadhi Avasthaa, Dosha Avasthaa etc). Mrittikaa Bhakshan`ajanya Roga - These can be anything from Paan`d`oo to Krimi Roga etc. The main treatment of it is to eliminate the habit of eating soil. It should be treated by S`hodhana, S`hamana including Paat`haadi Ghrita for diseases caused by soil eating. Taalukan`t`ka  It is caused due to the vitiated Kapha Dosha. Due to this it produces depression at the anterior fontanele on the head.  Preventive measures The diseases in children are mainly caused by the vitiated milk or food. To keep the children away from diseases one has to see that the milk he / she are consuming is free from vitiation. The mother should be healthy. The food consumed by the mother should be wholesome and healthy.

Daivavyapaas`hraya These types of treatment help in removing the bad effects caused by evil spirits. Saamaanya Chikitsaa The first factor of importance in the treatment is maintaining clean and sacred atmosphere around the affected child. The person looking after the child should refrain from Madya (consumption of alcohol), Maamsa (consumption of meat) and Vyavaaya (sexual gratification). The room should be clean and neat and should have fire, pious flowers and plants inside. A lamp of Sarshapa Taila should be kept lit in the room to make the room free from evil effects. Sarshapa should be used extensively for Rakshoghna Karma, seeds for Dhoopana, for spreading over the land, its oil for lighting the lamp.

They are slightly different from diseases of adults and need special      attention and treatment.  Diagnosis of Baala Roga      is challenging as physician has to depend on history and signs (Vaidyasamvedya      Lakshan`a). Physician should have proper knowledge Anumaana      and consider Hetu Sevana and other mother related factors (Stanya,      Aahaara etc). For example, child wherever touches and where he      can not tolerate the touch, it can be said that there is pain. When there is pain in the head, child closes his eyes. When there is pain in the Hridaya, child touches to Jihvaa,      Osht`ha, Das`hana. When there is Kosht`ha Vibandha, then there is Vamathu      (vomiting), Antra Koojana. Child beats the nipples at the time      of feeding. There is Aadhmaana, Prisht`ha Nama,      Jat`hara Unnamana also. When there is pain in the Basti and Guhya Sthaana,      there is Pureesha and Mootra Sanga.

Ksheeraalasaka Stanya      is vitiated by all the three Dosha. By consuming this Stanya,      a baby passes the stools which has Durgandhee (foul smell), Aama,      resembling to water, Vibaddha, Achchha, Phenila. There are different colours to the stools. Urine turns to yellow, white and dense. Jvara, Arochaka, Trit`, Chhardi S`hushkodgaara, Vijrimbhikaa, Angabhanga, AngaVikshepa, Koojana, Vepathu and Bhrama, Ghraan`a and AkshiPaaka.

Ayurveda considers Baala since birth up to 16 years. Again the Baala stage is divided into: Ksheerapa: Since birth up to one year. Ksheeraannaada: From second year to third year. Annaada: From fourth year to sixteen year. In Baala stage all the body constituents such as Dhaatu, Upadhaatu are in Apakva stage. The environment has a direct influence on psychological and general growth of Baala, hence needs special care and attention to cope up with the same. And therefore emphasis on Baalaka Paricharyaa has been given utmost importance. The aim of this Paricharyaa is to help the child to get adjusted to the world he has recently joined for his / her healthy psychological, physiological and physical development. Also some diseases are specific for specific Avasthaa like Stanya related diseases take place in Ksheerapa and Ksheeraannaada Avasthaa and then Paricharyaa changes accordingly. Navajaata S`his`hu Paricharyaa( Care of new born immediately after birth): The attendant should take care of the new born in the following way: She should generate sound by striking or rubbing two stones together near thebase of ear of the neonate, Sprinkle hot or cold water alternately over face of the child or based on season i.e. cold water during summer and hot during winter. With these procedures the child gets relieve from the stress caused by at the time of delivery. This is not a rule but exceptional, in case the neonate does not cry for a long time. Ulba (vernix caseosa) should be removed with rock salt and Ghrita. Then bath should be given and anal orifice should also be cleaned. The woman should wrap the finger, nail of which is already trimmed with well washed cotton swab and cleanse the palate, lips, throat and tongue of the child and then cover the Brahmarandhra (anterior fontanelle) with cotton soaked in oil. Ghrita mixed with rock salt should be given orally for producing emesis. Cutting of the umbilical cord and Jaatakarma should be done according to the rituals of that particular area and then first feeding with honey and Ghrita chanted with Mantra should be given. General Management: The child should be wrapped with linen cloth and made to sleep on a bed covered with linen cloth. Rakshoghna drugs should be hung on upper portion of the doorframe. Small packets of these drugs should be tied on neck of the puerperal woman and child. This entire Rakshaakarma is aimed at offering protection from infective disorders to the mother and child. Diet of the neonate from first to fourth day after birth: On first day honey and Ghrita mixed with Aanantaa should be given thrice. On second and third day Lakshman`aa Siddha Ghrita in the amount which fills the palm of neonate should be given. Then breast feeding should be initiated. Care should be taken first few drops to be squeezed and repelled before taking child for feeding, every time.After Jaatakarma Paricharyaa is over the Sanskaara Karma should be done according to rituals as prevalent in the family.

The approach towards motherhood is holistic, encompassing pregnancy, childbirth, and post-partum care. Ayurveda provides guidance on the quality of the seed (genetic material) and the development of both male and female during adolescence. It advises special attention to the nutrition and protection of the woman during pregnancy, considering her as the soil that nurtures the seed. The rules of sexual intercourse, antenatal care, and diet are laid down to ensure the well-being of both the mother and the developing child. Ayurveda describes the general management of pregnancy under Garbhin`ee Vyaakaran`a, with separate chapters for general management, special management, diseases in pregnancy, and their treatment. The physician is advised to be cautious and aim at protecting and nourishing both the fetus and the mother. The development of the fetus in the uterus is described under Garbhaavakraanti, and special regimes are prescribed for each month under Garbhin`ee Paricharyaa. The general rule is to take greater care during the first three months of pregnancy and after the completion of the seventh month. During the first trimester, stress is laid on stabilizing the pregnancy and nurturing the uterine bed through Rasa and Rakta Dhaatu_s. The embryo gets nourishment directly by percolation (Upsnehana). Hence more (Jaleeya) liquid substances such as juicy fruits, coconut water, milk, and so on are advocated. In the first month, sipping cold milk and maintaining a light diet, and during the next two months, the intake of milk medicated with herbs like Vidaaree, Shataavaree, Yasht`imadhu, Braahmee and so on, which are (Jeevaneeya) life-building and (Garbhasthaapaka) helping Nidation, are advocated. Honey and ghee are also recommended. By the end of the third month, the body parts of the fetus become differentiated, sensory perceptions and motor reactions start developing, the heart starts beating, and it is said to express its desires through the mother. This is the period when the woman craves for certain foods/flavors. The needs of both the fetus and the mother are identical. Hence, Ayurveda recommends that her cravings be fulfilled as far as possible, if not contraindicated. Braahmee helps in calming the nerves and is also a good (Prajaasthaapana) sustainer of pregnancy. From the fourth to the seventh month, drugs, which give strength to the uterine muscles and nourishment to the embryo, are advised e.g. Ashvagandhaa, Krauncha Beeja and Gud`oochi. They help to prevent intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). Nourishment starts through the umbilical cord by the (Kedaara Kulyaa) channels in the field for reach of moistening, method. The diet should be one of rice, milk, butter and ghee. Fruits, which are orange or yellow in color, are advocated such as mangoes, apples, and carrots, Aamalakee etc. Leafy vegetables are also advised during the seventh month. The abdominal skin gets stretched giving rise to itching and striations, called Kikkvisa. This should be treated by taking sips of the infusion of berries or butter medicated with Manjist`haa, the application of the pulp of sandalwood and lotus or of a paste made of neem, basil and Manjist`haa, or oil medicated with Karaveera leaves or jasmine. From the seventh month onwards, there should be less fat, less salt and less water in the diet. Rice and kaanji with a little ghee is advocated. After the completion of the seventh month, herbs, which are mild diuretics and urinary antiseptics such as Gokshura and Saarivaa, are advocated. Basil in small quantities is advised; it is also anti-spasmodic. As soon as the pregnant woman enters the ninth month, she is supposed to move to the Sootikaagaara (delivery area), which is specially prepared for delivery. After an Asthaapana Basti (simple enema), she should undergo Anuvaasana Basti (retention enema of medicated oil with some herbs), which may be repeated. Tampons soaked in the same oil are kept in the vagina to make the pelvis soft and elastic and enhance the excretory functions of Apaana Vaayu (urination, defecation), which facilitates the expulsion of the fetus. The skin and nails become soft, and her strength and complexion are rejuvenated. Spotting of blood during any month of pregnancy is considered to be serious and should be dealt with as advocated under Maasaanumaasika Chikitsaa, which describes the specific protective treatment, month wise. The Sootikaagaara should be such as to meet seasonal needs. The type of land, the timber used for building, the architectural layout of the area (the bath room, toilet, kitchen, fire place, delivery room) the type of fire wood used, the water supply and so on are described in detail. Materials such as linen needles and instruments essential drugs and furniture are also specified. The house should be fumigated to make it free from insects. Porous bags containing Rakshoghna drugs should be suspended all around at the entrance and at the corners to ward off insect, bacteria and unseen evil elements (Rakshoghna drugs are supposed to kill or repel them). These drugs are Calamus asafetida, garlic, Guggulu and Sarshapa. The nurse or birth attendant recommended by Ayurveda, should be experienced, friendly, alert, an expert, affectionate by nature, concerned and caring. The attending physician should be an expert also. Any diseases occurring for in a pregnant woman should be treated with drugs that are mild in action compatible and safe for the fetus. Panchakarma (detoxifying procedures) should not be advocated, except Basti (enema) and Pichu (tampon) in the eighth and ninth months of pregnancy. Ayurveda also describes nine diseases, which are caused because of the pregnant status of the woman. These diseases are peculiar to pregnancy and are called Garbhopadrava_s. They are nausea, anorexia, and vomiting dryness of mouth, fever, Edema, Anemia, diarrhea and retention of urine. Their specific treatments are also elaborately described. As far as possible, medication should be avoided during the first three months of pregnancy. Only symptomatic treatment with very mild herbs and a suitable diet should be offered. The physician is advised to take into account the severity of the disease, the resistance power of the mother and the duration of the pregnancy, and choose the middle path so that the disease or the treatments do not result in sequelae in the mother or the fetus. For example, the use of Das`hamoolarisht`a in vaataja fever, cold infusion of Glycerriza lotus and Saarivaa in Paittika fever and Gud`oochi, Vaasaa quash in Kapha fever to bring down temperature. Similar special treatments are advised for other diseases. Drugs such as Vachaa, Kumaaree, are contraindicated in pregnancy and substances like garlic and asafetida are to be used cautiously. Different types of obstructed labor and their management with maneuvers, especially internally rotation, are also described in this section. If the physician notices that the disease is going to be dangerous to the mother, especially in the Garbhopadrava_s, no time should be lost in terminating the pregnancy. Even three thousand years ago, thus Ayurveda has stressed the importance of safe motherhood. It aims at excellence in the formation of the fetus, its development without anomalies, a comfortable full term delivery, and maintenance of the health of the mother. Today, with a better understanding of the Physio-pathological processes and the advancement of allied sciences, we have put together a safe motherhood program for women in the form of a package namely, combating anemia, immunization of the mother, regular antenatal check up to detect any pathology in the fetus or the mother, to predict the course of delivery and take appropriate interventions, if necessary, and finally the delivery by a trained person. But, if we really wish to bring down maternal mortality in a big way the Ayurveda approach can certainly contribute in a significant manner. Some areas where integration can be thought of are An integrated program for safe motherhood may be evolved by using these suggestions. I wish to conclude with a quotation from Maharshi Kashyapa, which means: Out of sheer love, affection and compassion, the would-be mother bears all the agony to protect the child with grace and dignity.

Nagral Ayurveda, the ancient Indian medical science, describes safe motherhood thus, Motherhood is the basis of family life which, in turn, is the backbone of al the orders of society. Hence, family life remains protected if the woman is safe and protected. This great science compares conception to the germination and sprouting of a seed and its transformation into a sapling. When the male and female seeds unite and the soul enters the union, it becomes an embryo (Garbha). Ayurveda gives importance to the quality of the seed and hence to the development during adolescence, of both the male and female. In addition to the seed, the mother also provides the soil, nutrition and the right season for the seed to grow. Hence, Ayurveda advises special attention to aid to the nutrition and protection of the woman to keep her (the soil) rich and clean. It further advises that a female less than sixteen years of age and a male less than twenty should not bear a child. The rules of sexual intercourse are also laid down. So also, those of antenatal care; the husband and other family members are advised to take care of the pregnant womans diet and encourage activities that are dear to her and beneficial to the foetus or child growing in her body. Thus, the approach towards motherhood, that is pregnancy and childbirth, is a holistic one. Such concepts are excellent, but the question is, are they practiced? In fact, it needs thorough introspection on our part to find out why this approach was abandoned. Ayurveda describes the general management of pregnancy under Garbhin`ee Vyaakaran`a. There are separate chapters for general management, special management, diseases in pregnancy and their treatment and so on. Rules concerning diet, activities, behavior and mental activities; (Aahaara, Vihaara, Aachaara and Vichaara) respectively are also laid down. The physician is cautioned and advised to be very careful about the management of pregnancy; if a vessel of mud yet to be baked, is filled with oil right up to the brim, is to be carried without spilling even a single drop, every step has to be carefully watched. The same is the case in the management of a pregnant woman. The physician should aim at protecting and nourishing both the foetus and the mother. From the moment the pregnancy is confirmed, the woman is advised to follow certain rules. The physician steps in and starts supervision so that the pregnancy can terminate in a normal delivery at the scheduled time. Especially when she approaches full term, critical care is necessary as one of her feet is considered to be in this world and the other in the world of Yama (the god of death). Delivery is not complete unless the placenta is delivered. If the delivery is not normal, says this ancient science; the woman is likely to be affected by one or the other of a list of 64 ailments, which are described in detail in Garbhin`ee Vyaakaran`a. Sometimes, even an expert, can get baffled by situations arising during the course of pregnancy, delivery, and post delivery period. Hence, the physician has to have foresight, definite convictions, expertise, experience and compassion while taking on the responsibility of a pregnant woman. He has to think of the welfare of two individuals at the same time,  that of the mother and the foetus. Both are to be nourished and protected. The requirements of both are usually identical. But, if they happen to clash, the protection of mother should be the first priority. If a couple desires to have a good progeny, both the partners should be careful about their diet, activities, behavior and emotional status before as well as after conception. One has to keep this in mind throughout the pregnancy. The food she eats should be tasty, more of it should be in a liquid form, moist, nourishing, enriched with all the six (Rasa) tastes and treated by (Deepana) drugs, which are known to increase appetite and digestive power. She should always avoid Garbhin`ee Paricharyaa (specific care) The development of the foetus in the uterus is described under Garbhaavakraanti, and special regimes and prescribed for each month under Garbhin`ee Paricharyaa.

As soon as the pregnant woman enters the ninth month, she is supposed to move to the Sootikaagaara (delivery area), which is specially prepared for delivery. After an Asthaapana Basti (simple enema), she should undergo Anuvaasana Basti (retention enema of medicated oil with some herbs), which may be repeated. Tampons soaked in the same oil are kept in the vagina to make the pelvis soft and elastic and enhance the excretory functions of Apaana Vaayu (urination, defecation), which facilitates the expulsion of the foetus. The skin and nails become soft, and her strength and complexion are rejuvenated. Spotting of blood during any month of pregnancy is considered to be serious and should be dealt with as advocated under Maasaanumaasika Chikitsaa, which describes the specific protective treatment, month wise. The Sootikaagaara should be such as to meet seasonal needs. The type of land, the timber used for building, the architectural layout of the area (the bath room, toilet, kitchen, fire place, delivery room) the type of fire wood used, the water supply and so on are described in detail. Materials such as linen needles and instruments essential drugs and furniture are also specified. The house should be fumigated to make it free from insects. Porous bags containing Rakshoghna drugs should be suspended all around  at the entrance and at the corners  to ward off insect, bacteria and unseen evil elements (Rakshoghna drugs are supposed to kill or repel them). These drugs are Calamus asafetida, garlic, Guggulu and Sarshapa. The nurse or birth attendant recommended by Ayurveda, should be experienced, friendly, alert, an expert, affectionate by nature, concerned and caring. The attending physician should be an expert also. Any diseases occurring for in a pregnant woman should be treated with drugs that are mild in action compatible and safe for the foetus. Panchakarma (detoxifying procedures) should not be advocated, except Basti (enema) and Pichu (tampon) in the eighth and ninth months of pregnancy. Ayurveda also describes nine diseases, which are caused because of the pregnant status of the woman. These diseases are peculiar to pregnancy and are called Garbhopadrava_s. They are nausea, anorexia, and vomiting dryness of mouth, fever, Edema, Anemia, diarrhea and retention of urine. Their specific treatments are also elaborately described. As far as possible, medication should be avoided during the first three months of pregnancy. Only symptomatic treatment with very mild herbs and a suitable diet should be offered. The physician is advised to take into account the severity of the disease, the resistance power of the mother and the duration of the pregnancy, and choose the middle path so that the disease or the treatments do not result in sequelae in the mother or the foetus. For example, the use of Das`hamoolarisht`a in vaataja fever, cold infusion of Glycerriza lotus and Saarivaa in Paittika fever and Gud`oochi, Vaasaa quash in Kapha fever to bring down temperature. Similar special treatments are advised for other diseases. Drugs such as Vachaa, Kumaaree, are contraindicated in pregnancy and substances like garlic and asafetida are to be used cautiously. Different types of obstructed labor and their management with maneuvers, especially internally rotation, are also described in this section. If the physician notices that the disease is going to be dangerous to the mother, especially in the Garbhopadrava_s, no time should be lost in terminating the pregnancy. Even three thousand years ago, thus Ayurveda has stressed the importance of safe motherhood. It aims at excellence in the formation of the foetus, its development without anomalies, a comfortable full term delivery, and maintenance of the health of the mother. Today, with a better understanding of the Physio-pathological processes and the advancement of allied sciences, we have put together a safe motherhood program for women in the form of a package namely, combating anemia, immunization of the mother, regular antenatal check up to detect any pathology in the foetus or the mother, to predict the course of delivery and take appropriate interventions, if necessary, and finally the delivery by a trained person. But, if we really wish to bring down maternal mortality in a big way the Ayurveda approach can certainly contribute in a significant manner. Some areas where integration can be thought of are An integrated program for safe motherhood may be evolved by using these suggestions. I wish to conclude with a quotation from Maharshi Kashyapa, which means: Out of sheer love, affection and compassion, the would-be mother bears all the agony to protect the child with grace and dignity. That is really the greatness of MOTHERHOOD.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9b884e0a-af15-48de-a164-7195d22b4560": {"__data__": {"id_": "9b884e0a-af15-48de-a164-7195d22b4560", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"tag": "p", "file_path": "/home/dai/rag/data/clean_html/Articles/Stree_Roga_Prasuti_Tantra_Baala_Roga/Garbhinee_Paricharyaa.htm", "file_name": "Garbhinee_Paricharyaa.htm", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 4737, "creation_date": "2024-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-14", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-15", "summary": "Ayurveda places great importance on the birth of healthy children with sound bodies, minds, and souls.

Ayurveda believes in Suprajaajanana ie. birth of a baby with healthy body, mind and soul. And hence for a birth of a healthy baby Ayurveda suggest some rules to follow right from the menarche. Sus`hruta has suggested the marriageable age of man as twenty-five and of girl as sixteen years. For proper conception Ritu (season or period near ovulation or Ritukaala), Beeja (seed i.e. ovum and sperms), Kshetra (field i.e. female reproductive system esp. uterus), and Ambu (nourishing substances), S`hukra, properly functioning Vaayu and normal physiological and mental status are essential. As the conception takes place, the normal physiological, psychological and physical status gradually changes in the pregnant woman. The foetus gets affected mentally, physiologically by the deeds of the pregnant woman and hence the emphasis has been given on the diet and life style of the pregnant woman from conception itself. Garbhin`ee Paricharyaa: (Antenatal Care): Saamaanya Aahaara- Vihaara (Wholesome Diet and life style): The antenatal care starts from the moment the female become pregnant. The woman should follow congenial diet and mode of life and protect herself by following good conduct. Woman should remain in high spirit, pious, wear clean and simple cloths and perform religious rites, do auspicious deeds and worship. The diet should be taken considering place of living, time of season and digestive capacity. The woman should consume S`haalee and Shasht`ika rice, Mudga(green gram), wheat, flour of parched rice, butter, pure ghee, milk, Rasaalaa, honey, jack-fruit, Aamalakee fruit, grapes, sour and sweet substances etc. Anointment with cooling agents like sandal, wearing of garlands, moonlight bath, massage, soft bed, cool air, gratifying edibles, embracing beloved and other pleasing mode of life along with desired food should be followed. Maasaanumaasika Pathya (Month wise dietary regimen):  Along with the above dietary regimen Ayurveda has suggested specific medicated decoctions (Maasaanumaasika Kvaatha) for each month. The drugs mentioned in these decoctions for each month are in accordance with the foetal development in the respective month. Also specific medicated decoctions for each month are mentioned for abortion (Garbhasraavahara Kvaatha) and if complications occur. Benefits of the month wise dietary regimen: The woman remains healthy and delivers the child possessing good health, strength, voice, compactness and much superior to other family members.

During Sootikaa Avasthaa, since all Dhaatu decrease and become lay due to development of foetus, due to labour pains and loss blood; her digestive power, muscle power and strength decrease, hence greater attention has to be given to her. According to Ayurveda the term Sootikaa (puerperal woman) can be used only after expulsion of placenta. Regarding Sootikaa Kaaala (duration of puerperium) Sus`hruta and Vaagbhat`a have said it to be of one and half month duration. Some suggest the duration of puerperium till the onset of her menstrual cycle, while Kaas`hyapa has mentioned the puerperium duration of six month. The main emphasis of Ayurveda for Sootikaa Paricharyaa is for Agni Rakshaa, to prevent vitiation of Vaata Dosha and to regain the normal physiology and psychology. Sootikaa Paricharyaa (Management of puerperal woman): General Management: Puerperal woman should be given massage, oral administration of Vasaa, Sneha with medicines and Panchakola decoction for three to seven days after delivery. After digestion of the Sneha, Snehayukta Panchakola Siddha Yavaagoo should be given which the woman can easily digest, as diet. After this, her abdomen should be massaged and wrapped properly with a big clean cloth to prevent vitiation of Vaata Dosha. During both times i.e. morning and evening irrigation or bath with hot water should be given. After that Yavaagoo should be given. This regimen should be followed for three, five or seven nights along with light diet comprising, soup of Yava, Kola and Kulattha. Masaage with Balaa oil should be followed by consumption of Bhadradaarvyaadi decoction. Puerperal woman should avoid anger, exercise, cold air and coitus. The woman unfit for use of oily substances should be given either Laghupanchamoola decoction or drugs capable of suppressing Vaata Dosha. After twelve nights, giving due consideration to strength and digestive capacity, gradual strengthening should be done by meat soup of wild animals, decoction of Jeevaneeya, Brimnhan`eeya, Madhura, Vaataghna drugs, in form of massage, irrigation and bathing. Puerperal woman should use specifically Rakshoghna and beneficial substances. Detailed management should be done, giving due consideration to place of living, and traditions of the family. Specific Management: This includes the puerperal management on basis of living places. Aanoopa Desha: Due to dominance of moisture in this area, initially Vasaa should not be used. Agni and Balavardhaka Man`d`a etc. should be used. All Ushn`a drugs, sudation and sleeping in wind free place are beneficial. Jaangala Desha: The woman of this area should be given with Ghritaadi Sneha in good quantity with decoction of Pippalee for Balavatee woman for three or five nights. For Abalavatee woman Yavaagoopaana should be given for three or five nights. Puerperal woman should avoid anger, exercise and coitus. Saadhaaran`a Desha: The woman should follow general or average (use of neither too Snigdha nor Rooksha substances) regulations. Oil or Ghrita should be given for drinking in case of delivery of male or female child respectively. Yavaagoopaana should be given for three or five nights followed by Man`d`a etc. If any complication occurs then management should be done according to particular disease. As purifying measures can not be given, hence the diseases developing during this stage become incurable or get cured with difficulty. General treatment of Sootikaa Diseases: Avoidance of etiological factors is the best treatment.

The immune system defends the individual from infections with microbes such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa. Immune system also impedes the development of autoimmune and malignant diseases. There are 4 essential parts of protective immune system of the body namely humoral or antibody related immunity, cell-mediated immunity, phagocytosis, and complement system. Protection produced by the person's own immune system which is usually permanent Protection transferred from another person or animal as antibody and is temporary protection that wanes with time Principles of vaccination: Self verses no self Protection from infectious disease Usually indicated by the presence of antibody Very specific to a single antigen immunity Active immunity produced by vaccine Immunity and immunologic memory similar to natural infection but without risk of disease Characteristic features of Live Attenuated Vaccines E.g. of Live Attenuated Vaccines Viral measles, mumps,rubella, varicella, yellow fever,  rubella, influenza, oral polio, BacterialBCG, oral typhoid Cannot replicate Minimal interference from circulating antibody Generally not as effective as live vaccines Generally require 3-5 doses Immune response mostly hum oral Antibody titre diminishes with time E.g. of Inactivated Vaccines Viral polio, hepatitis A, rabies (influenza)  Bacterial(pertussis) (typhoid)(cholera) (plague) Polysaccharide Vaccines pneumococcal meningococcal Salmonella Typhi (Vi) Haemophilus influenza type b pneumococcal Types of polysaccharide: Pure polysaccharide Conjugate polysaccharide Pure Polysaccharide Vaccines Not consistently immunogenic in children <2 years of age No booster response Antibody with less functional activity Immunogenicity improved by conjugation Vaccination in Children: BCG vaccine: Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) is an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis var. bovis, used as a live vaccine against tuberculosis. The vaccine is given from birth to two weeks. In order to maintain its potency, the vaccine is supplied in freeze-dried at 4 degree C. BCG is administered intradermally over the deltoid muscle. The dosage is 0.05 ml for newborns and 0.1ml for all other ages. The vaccine is given from birth to two weeks. BCG does not protect from other mycobacterial disease such as leprosy. In neonate and young infant, tuberculin testing is unnecessary before giving BCG. Tetanus Toxoid(Adsorbed): It is used to immunise children from age of 3 months onwards. Risk of tetanus neonatorum in infant is avoided by immunising pregnant woman. For active primary immunisation : 2doses at an interval of 4to 6 weeks. Reinforcing dose should be given 9 to 12 months later to increase the level of immunity. Booster dose should be given every 5 years to maintain adequate level of immunity even if they do not suffer from any injury. Hepatitis B vaccine:  Hepatitis B is an infection of the liver thats caused by a virus and can result in liver damage or failure. Some babies can develop Hepatitis B if their mothers are infected with it before or during pregnancy. Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP) vaccine: This vaccine protects against three diseasesdiphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis or whooping cough: Diphtheria is a serious infectious disease caused by bacteria that produce toxins which inflame the nervous system and heart and can result in heart failure and paralysis. Tetanus results from bacteria that grow in wounds and that produce a toxin which affects the nervous system and causes muscle spasms and paralysis, especially in the jaw area. Its also called lockjaw. Pertussis or whooping cough, another infectious disease caused by bacteria, is especially dangerous for babies under the age of 1. Its most well-known symptom is a debilitating racking cough.  The vaccine should be given in five doses at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, around 18 months, and before the child enters school, between 4 and 6 years of age. A sixth dose of diphtheria and tetanus vaccine is recommended between 11 and 16 years of age.  Baby may have a mild reaction to this vaccine including a slight fever (under 102 degrees F), fussiness, and redness in the thigh area where the shot is given. These symptoms typically last up to 2 days and doctor may suggest giving the child some baby acetaminophen to ease the fever. Haemophilic influenza type B (HIB) vaccine:  Haemophilus influenzae type b isnt the viral infection that everybody calls the flu. Instead, its a fast-moving bacterial infection that can cause baby to have ear and bronchial infections. HIB also can lead to meningitis in children under the age of 2, so it is important that protect the child with the HIB vaccine. Before the age of six months: At 6, 10, 14 weeks followed by a booster 12 months after last injection. Children not vaccinated before 6 months of age: 2 dose and booster 12 months after 2 nd dose. Children not vaccinated before 1year of age: 1dose. Poliomyelitis vaccine (oral) i.e. OPV:  Polio, short for poliomyelitis, is a serious viral disease that starts with a fever and can lead to paralysis, muscle atrophy, and permanent disability. In its most severe forms, polio can cause death. Oral polio vaccine developed by sabin and is given by mouth at birth to 2 months, 2,4, 6, 6-9 months, 18 months, 4-6years, 6years. Heptavalent Conjugate Pneumococcal (PCV) vaccine:  This vaccine protects your child against the pneumococcal bacteria which can cause meningitis, pneumonia, and serious infections in a child's brain, blood stream, and ears. First vaccination: A single injection confirms protection against pnuemococcal types contained in the vaccine. Revaccination should not be carried before 5 years, unless the subject is particularly exposed. Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine:  This vaccine provides coverage for three diseases in a single shotmeasles, mumps, and rubella or German measles:  Measles is a viral infection that causes distinctive red spots and is characterized by cold-like symptoms and a high fever.  Mumps is an infectious viral disease that results in swelling of the parotid gland thats just in front of the ear and the salivary glands. The swelling can occur on the sides of one or both cheeks. Mumps usually is accompanied by a fever and pain when the patient opens his mouth or eats.  Rubella or German measles is similar to measles in that its a viral infection that results in a fever, swollen glands, and a rash.  The first MMR vaccine is usually recommended between 12 and 15 month of age and seldom has any serious side effects. Baby, however, may be more sleepy than usual and have a mild rash, slight fever, or slight swelling in the neck or diaper area. The second shot (booster) is recommended between 4 to 6 years of age. Varicella (Var) vaccine:  vaccine protects against chicken pox, a viral infection which is highly contagious and results in a blister like rash thats very itchy. Varicella vaccine is indicated for active immunisation against varicella in healthy subjects from the age of 12 months onward. 12 months-12 years: 1dose 13 years and above: 2dose with an interval of 6-10 weeks. Influenza vaccine:  The influenza vaccine is more commonly known as the flu shot. The flu is more serious than the common cold and can be very dangerous in young children, especially those with certain medical conditions. For this children 6 months of age or older with certain risk factors receive the influenza vaccine yearly. It can also be given to other children. If you aren't sure if your child should receive this vaccine, ask your child's doctor. Children 6months to 3years of age: 1injection of 0.25ml Children 3years and all ages: 1injection of 0.5ml. Children under 8 years of age who have not been infected or Vaccinated previously should be given a 2 nd dose after an interval of at least 4 weeks. Measles Vaccine: It is a lyophilized preparation of the highly attenuated Schwarz strain of measles virus, obtained by propagation of the virus, obtained by propagation of virus in chick embryo tissue cultures. The optimal age for active vaccination is 15 months. The vaccine pellet should be completely dissolved in the diluent. The entire contents of a reconstituted monodose vial or 0.5 ml of reconstituted vaccine from a multi dose vial should be injected subcutaneously. Hepatitis A vaccine: It is a sterile suspension containing formaldehyde-inactivated hepatitis A virus adsorbed onto aluminium hydroxide. First dose should be given at elected date and second one month later. Booster dose is recommended at any time between 6and 12 months after initiation of primary course. Vaccine should be used intramuscularly and the dose is 0.5ml/not less than 360 ELISA units.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc564f42-c4da-48f8-a22f-96889fa8db12": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc564f42-c4da-48f8-a22f-96889fa8db12", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"tag": "p", "file_path": "/home/dai/rag/data/clean_html/Articles/Stree_Roga_Prasuti_Tantra_Baala_Roga/Yoni_Dhaarana.htm", "file_name": "Yoni_Dhaarana.htm", "file_type": "text/html", "file_size": 642, "creation_date": "2024-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-14", "last_accessed_date": "2024-02-15", "summary": "I am sorry, but the provided reference passage does not contain sufficient information to summarize Ayurveda medicine comprehensively.

When these constituents are in balance, health prevails. However, external or internal factors can disrupt this equilibrium, leading to disease.\n\nAyurvedic management aims to re-establish this lost balance by employing two main approaches:\n\n1. Shodhana (Purification): This involves eliminating vitiated Doshas (imbalances) from the body through five main procedures: Vamana (induced vomiting), Virechana (induced purging), Basti (medicated enemas), Nasya (nasal instillations), and Raktamokshana (bloodletting).\n\n2. Shamana (Palliation): This approach focuses on converting harmful substances into non-toxic forms without eliminating them from the body. It includes seven types of measures:\n\n   - Paachana: Improving digestion to reduce toxic substances\n   - Deepana: Intensifying digestive fire\n   - Kshut Nirodha: Withholding hunger\n   - Trit'nirodha: Withholding thirst\n   - Vyaayaama: Physical exercise\n   - Aatapa Sevaa: Exposure to sunlight\n   - Marut Sevaa: Exposure to dry, clean air\n\nIn addition to these two main approaches, Ayurveda also incorporates Rasaayana (rejuvenation), Vaajikaran'a (reproductive tissue metabolism), Daivavyapaas'hraya (rituals and offerings), Satvaavajaya (psychological measures), and Yuktivyapaas'hraya (rational management using medicine or surgery).\n\nThe management of any disease involves a team effort between the Vaidya (physician), Dravya (substances used for treatment), Upasthaataa (attendant), and Rogee (patient).

The disease state is examined later. The word Prakriti (constitution) not only gives perception of the anatomical features but also provides an insight into the deeper internal mechanism of an individual in terms of physiology, psychology and quality and excellence of tissues.\n\nPrakriti is the Ayurvedic profile or unique psychosomatic temperament of an individual, encompassing his or her physical, functional and behavioral characteristics. The varying proportions of Kapha, Pitta or Vaata Dosha determine the S`haareera Prakriti or the Dosha Prakriti i.e., the body type which play a pivotal role. While all individuals have mixed sum of the three Gun`a, the predominant Gun`a determines an individuals Maanasa Prakriti.\n\nEvaluation of Maanasa Prakriti, i.e., psycho-spiritual profile is made by identifying the predominance of Psychic factors i.e., Sattva, Raja and Tama.\n\nDhaatu are termed as body constituents. These are seven in number and their qualitative assessment can be performed by Saarataa Pareekshan`a. Saara is the essence of that particular constituent. It reflects on various body parts in positive manner by which it is assessed.\n\nLike genetic coding, every individual has a different combination and is therefore a distinct entity in itself. That is the reason why two people react differently when exposed to a similar situation. Thus according to Aayurveda everyone is unique and each one of them has a distinct body constitution, which is completely different from each other. Nature of emotions, thought, and behavior patterns are unique to a person and are exhibited in a wide range of social and personal environment. Interpretation of the same is necessary for their behavior in cultural, social and home environment.\n\n**Need for understanding the concept of Prakriti**\n\nBy knowing our constitution it is possible to locate our drawbacks and live at peace with natures wishes. There are some simple rules that help in the long run. The Dosha that predominate due to our genetic inheritance dictates certain demands in terms of diet, life style and environment. If we recognize this and try to follow it, we will be able to achieve health.\n\nThese are the following important reasons why knowing your Prakriti is the first step toward perfect health:\n\n1. By understanding Prakriti and their specific strengths and weaknesses, you can begin to take preventive steps long before overt illness appears. Prakriti makes prevention more precise.\n\n2. If you try to prevent every disease without knowing your particular predisposition, its like aiming in the dark. Prakriti makes treatment more accurate once a disease appears.\n\n3. Study of Prakriti offers reference points for managing treatment decisions specific to each case.\n\n4. Study of Prakriti helps in understanding variations in disease manifestation\n\n**Scope of Prakriti**\n\nThe scope of Prakriti is vast and includes the following:\n\n1. Prevention of disease\n\n2. Treatment of disease\n\n3. Understanding variations in disease manifestation\n\n4. Management of treatment decisions\n\n5. Promotion of health and well-being\n\nI hope this summary is helpful.

These factors contribute to the genesis of Prakriti, which is not merely a categorization of individuals based on physical characteristics but also an evaluation of their attributes to assess the dominance of particular Doshas or Gunas.\n\nTypes of Prakriti are classified based on Tridosha, Triguna, and Mahaabhoota, known as Dehaprakriti, Maanasprakriti, and Bhautikprakriti, respectively. Dehaprakriti, or Doshaprakriti, focuses on physical characteristics and includes seven types: Ekdoshja (dominance of one Dosha), Dvidoshaja (dominance of two Doshas), and Sama Prakriti (balanced state of all three Doshas).\n\nMaanasprakriti, also known as Gunaprakriti, deals with mental attributes and has seven types, similar to Dehaprakriti.

Instead, cognition is done by inferencing knowledge through observation of different Hetu, or factors proving the presence of the objects. This type of knowledge is dependent on previous direct, object cognition. The relation between the Hetu and the object is previously observed and memorized leading to correlate both and inferring the presence of the object without its being directly seen. The process is scientifically elaborated by the oriental sciences. The different terms are defined and explained in detail in order to understand this process easily. These terms will be well understood when explained along with an example. Lets take an example to prove the presence of a fire and a mountain. Saadhya: Is the object whose presence is to be proved e.g. fire Hetu: Is the factor, which is in constant relation with Saadhya the object. Hence leading to confirm the presence of Saadhya without directly bringing into contact the sense organs with the subject i.e. smoke. Pakshya: Is the site where the presence of Saadhya is to be proved. e.g. The Mountain where the presence of fire is to be proved. Sapakshya: Site where the relationship of the Sandhya and the Hetu is assertively confirmed. E.g. the kitchen where smoke and fire are always present. Vipakshya: It is the site where the Saadhya or the object is definitely absent. e.g. the water bodies where fire is never present. Pakshadharma: The Pakshya is the site where the object is to be proved. So the main purpose of the site is that is has the presence of the object. e.g.: The presence of fire on the mountain is the Pakshyadharma or the purpose of the mountain for that period. Vyaapti: The invariable relation between the Hetu and the Saadhya technically termed as the Avinabhava. The status of non-existence if the other one is not present is called Vyaapti. In other words it is defined as the certainty of association of the presence of smoke only in the presence of fire. Concomitance of smoke and fire. To have a flawless inference Vyaapti should be clear. Paraamars`ha: It means knowledge of qualified reason existing on a subject. Thus to know the concomitance of smoke and fire and to also directly cognize the presence of smoke on the mountain, leading to inferring the presence of fire on the mountain. Anumitee: It is the knowledge achieved due to Paraamars`ha. Concomitance is ascertained by the presence of association and absence of variation. But mere concomitance is not sufficient. The presence of the smoke on the mountain is also important. The fire should not be seen along with the smoke on the mountain. If it is seen then the knowledge thus gained will be termed as direct perception instead of inference as the sense organs come in direct contact with the Saadhya or object whose presence has to be proved. Hence for inference one should note that there should be some doubt about the subject to be proved prior to the judgment. To know the concomitance of smoke and fire and to also directly cognize the presence of smoke on the mountain leading to the inference of the presence of fire on the mountain is known as Paraamars`ha. Sad Hetu / Valid reason: Hetu or reason means the symptom or the factor by which, the Saadhya or subject is to be proved. The other synonyms for Hetu are or Sadhan i.e. reason. Sad Hetu means the factors, which lead to the inference of true knowledge. The criteria for calling any symphonic Hetu, Sad Hetu i.e. valid reasons are as follows: I.e. presence of smoke on mountain, I.e. presence of smoke and fire together in kitchen. I.e. absence of smoke on water bodies. I.e. absence of rain in presence of smoke I.e. Presence of smoke along with fire, when seen directly or when climbing the mountain. All this mental exercise of inference and judgment is done for drawing some conclusion. Positive or negative, the Hetu should be true and not fake. Five of the valid reasons have been explained The Hetu described are of 3 types Purely positive Hetu  Kevala Anvaya Hetu Purely negative Hetu  Kevala Vyatireka Hetu Duly positive and negative Hetu After seeing the nine technical terms of Anumaana, we need to understand Vyaapti and Paraamars`ha in detail as knowledge obtained from inference is based on correct knowledge of these two. Vyaapti or Concomitance: It is the invariable relation between the Hetu and the Saadhya, the Avinabhara status of the non-existence of one if the other is not present. Vyaapti therefore is the rule of being together (Sahaacharya Niyatataa  a technically termed) e.g. the invariable concomitance of fire and smoke where there is smoke there is fire invariably. Smoke is pervasive but fire is pervading. That which is wide spread is Vyaapaka or fire and that which is pervaded is Vyaapya or smoke = fire and that which is pervaded is Vyaapya = smoke Wherever there is Vyaapya there always will be Vyaapaka. But the reverse will not be true. Hence it is important to know the differentiation of the Vyaapya and Vyaapaka. The Naiyayikas explain this difference by explaining two types of Vyaapti or concomitance. The Anvaya Vyaapti or the Vyatireka Vyaapti Anvaya Vyaapti  means stating putting forth a statement E.g: Having seen one poisonous snake if one holds each and every snake is poisonous. Then on seeing a non-poisonous snake there will be variation in the Vyaapti of snake = poisonous hence leading to the inference that false knowledge has been gained. Hence to avoid false knowledge, examining the Vyaapti by repeated exposure to the Vyaapya and Vyaapaka relationship has to be done. If any doubts are present in relation to established Vyaapti_s they should be eliminated by a thoughtful evaluation of the facts or Tarka. Keval Anvaya Vyaapti Hetu: This type of Hetu or factor can put forth only positive statements. No negative statement can be stated by this Hetu. E.g. The object of knowledge i.e. Prameya always has a name (Abhidiya). A jar is Prameya; the jar is denotable because of its cognoscibility; here deniability is the Hetu.  We cannot turn this statement into a negative Vyatireka statement by saying that the jar is not denotable because it is not cognizable, it will be a false statement. Keval Vyatireka Hetu: This type of Hetu or factor can state only negative statements. No positive statement can be stated by this Hetu. E.g. the earth element is distinguished from others by its quality of smell. So we can state that, which is not distinguished from another does not possess the quality of smell. Here smell is the Hetu. Anvaya Vyatireka Hetu: This type of Hetu or factor states both positive as well as negative statements. E.g. where there is smoke there is fire present as in a kitchen and wherever there is fire absent, smoke is also absent, as in a lake. Both the positive as well as the negative statements hold true. After knowing the types of Hetu_s we need to see how to derivate and communicate these inferences. For self-derivation of inference known as Svaarthaanumaana, one has to repeatedly observe and draw inferences from previous experiences and in newer and newer situations To communicate the inferences to others a systematic five component method, is prescribed as follows: This is the systematic method of rational submission for any topic. Lets see this with an example. Conclusion: On account of the smoke it is proved that the mountain is fiery. The entire logic is based upon reason. A said Hetu improper reason to begin with should be avoided. Fallacious reason leads to definitely wrong inference and consequently wrong judgments. Wrong or fallacious reasons are those which do not possess even one of the qualities describing valid reason or Sad Hetu. These Hetu areas are known as Hetvaabhaasa. The synonyms of Hetvaabhaasa are Asad Hetu, Dusht`ahetu, Ahetu. They are of five types. Over wide E.g.  Branding of animal as a cow by examining existence of over wide norms. Many other animals have norms without being a cow. So it roves the subject and simultaneously others too. Uncommon Discrepancy  Some one makes a statement that sound is eternal because of its S`habdatva. Here the reason taken is no likely to depend on other Dravya_s like soul etc. they have eternity as the reason, which does not exist on other Dravya_s of eternity nor does it depend on a jar, which is not eternal. So the Hetu is not present on the similar or negative factors, hence it cannot prove anything transitory because it is knowable. Here no similar or contrary instances are present. Since everything is included in the subject, no other item can be similar or contrary. Knowledge or reason for everything transient is inconclusive. Contradictions: It is contradictory to the thing to be proved. It proves the animal is a horse because it has horns. Here having horns is not proved on horses. There is negation of the existence of a horse. The contradictory reason therefore is defective. Now we will see the types of inferences described in Oriental Sciences.

The approach towards motherhood is holistic, encompassing pregnancy, childbirth, and post-partum care. Ayurveda provides guidance on the quality of the seed (genetic material) and the development of both male and female during adolescence. It advises special attention to the nutrition and protection of the woman during pregnancy, considering her as the soil that nurtures the seed. The rules of sexual intercourse, antenatal care, and diet are laid down to ensure the well-being of both the mother and the developing child. Ayurveda describes the general management of pregnancy under Garbhin`ee Vyaakaran`a, with separate chapters for general management, special management, diseases in pregnancy, and their treatment. The physician is advised to be cautious and aim at protecting and nourishing both the fetus and the mother. The development of the fetus in the uterus is described under Garbhaavakraanti, and special regimes are prescribed for each month under Garbhin`ee Paricharyaa. The general rule is to take greater care during the first three months of pregnancy and after the completion of the seventh month. During the first trimester, stress is laid on stabilizing the pregnancy and nurturing the uterine bed through Rasa and Rakta Dhaatu_s. The embryo gets nourishment directly by percolation (Upsnehana). Hence more (Jaleeya) liquid substances such as juicy fruits, coconut water, milk, and so on are advocated. In the first month, sipping cold milk and maintaining a light diet, and during the next two months, the intake of milk medicated with herbs like Vidaaree, Shataavaree, Yasht`imadhu, Braahmee and so on, which are (Jeevaneeya) life-building and (Garbhasthaapaka) helping Nidation, are advocated. Honey and ghee are also recommended. By the end of the third month, the body parts of the fetus become differentiated, sensory perceptions and motor reactions start developing, the heart starts beating, and it is said to express its desires through the mother. This is the period when the woman craves for certain foods/flavors. The needs of both the fetus and the mother are identical. Hence, Ayurveda recommends that her cravings be fulfilled as far as possible, if not contraindicated. Braahmee helps in calming the nerves and is also a good (Prajaasthaapana) sustainer of pregnancy. From the fourth to the seventh month, drugs, which give strength to the uterine muscles and nourishment to the embryo, are advised e.g. Ashvagandhaa, Krauncha Beeja and Gud`oochi. They help to prevent intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). Nourishment starts through the umbilical cord by the (Kedaara Kulyaa) channels in the field for reach of moistening, method. The diet should be one of rice, milk, butter and ghee. Fruits, which are orange or yellow in color, are advocated such as mangoes, apples, and carrots, Aamalakee etc. Leafy vegetables are also advised during the seventh month. The abdominal skin gets stretched giving rise to itching and striations, called Kikkvisa. This should be treated by taking sips of the infusion of berries or butter medicated with Manjist`haa, the application of the pulp of sandalwood and lotus or of a paste made of neem, basil and Manjist`haa, or oil medicated with Karaveera leaves or jasmine. From the seventh month onwards, there should be less fat, less salt and less water in the diet. Rice and kaanji with a little ghee is advocated. After the completion of the seventh month, herbs, which are mild diuretics and urinary antiseptics such as Gokshura and Saarivaa, are advocated. Basil in small quantities is advised; it is also anti-spasmodic. As soon as the pregnant woman enters the ninth month, she is supposed to move to the Sootikaagaara (delivery area), which is specially prepared for delivery. After an Asthaapana Basti (simple enema), she should undergo Anuvaasana Basti (retention enema of medicated oil with some herbs), which may be repeated. Tampons soaked in the same oil are kept in the vagina to make the pelvis soft and elastic and enhance the excretory functions of Apaana Vaayu (urination, defecation), which facilitates the expulsion of the fetus. The skin and nails become soft, and her strength and complexion are rejuvenated. Spotting of blood during any month of pregnancy is considered to be serious and should be dealt with as advocated under Maasaanumaasika Chikitsaa, which describes the specific protective treatment, month wise. The Sootikaagaara should be such as to meet seasonal needs. The type of land, the timber used for building, the architectural layout of the area (the bath room, toilet, kitchen, fire place, delivery room) the type of fire wood used, the water supply and so on are described in detail. Materials such as linen needles and instruments essential drugs and furniture are also specified. The house should be fumigated to make it free from insects. Porous bags containing Rakshoghna drugs should be suspended all around at the entrance and at the corners to ward off insect, bacteria and unseen evil elements (Rakshoghna drugs are supposed to kill or repel them). These drugs are Calamus asafetida, garlic, Guggulu and Sarshapa. The nurse or birth attendant recommended by Ayurveda, should be experienced, friendly, alert, an expert, affectionate by nature, concerned and caring. The attending physician should be an expert also. Any diseases occurring for in a pregnant woman should be treated with drugs that are mild in action compatible and safe for the fetus. Panchakarma (detoxifying procedures) should not be advocated, except Basti (enema) and Pichu (tampon) in the eighth and ninth months of pregnancy. Ayurveda also describes nine diseases, which are caused because of the pregnant status of the woman. These diseases are peculiar to pregnancy and are called Garbhopadrava_s. They are nausea, anorexia, and vomiting dryness of mouth, fever, Edema, Anemia, diarrhea and retention of urine. Their specific treatments are also elaborately described. As far as possible, medication should be avoided during the first three months of pregnancy. Only symptomatic treatment with very mild herbs and a suitable diet should be offered. The physician is advised to take into account the severity of the disease, the resistance power of the mother and the duration of the pregnancy, and choose the middle path so that the disease or the treatments do not result in sequelae in the mother or the fetus. For example, the use of Das`hamoolarisht`a in vaataja fever, cold infusion of Glycerriza lotus and Saarivaa in Paittika fever and Gud`oochi, Vaasaa quash in Kapha fever to bring down temperature. Similar special treatments are advised for other diseases. Drugs such as Vachaa, Kumaaree, are contraindicated in pregnancy and substances like garlic and asafetida are to be used cautiously. Different types of obstructed labor and their management with maneuvers, especially internally rotation, are also described in this section. If the physician notices that the disease is going to be dangerous to the mother, especially in the Garbhopadrava_s, no time should be lost in terminating the pregnancy. Even three thousand years ago, thus Ayurveda has stressed the importance of safe motherhood. It aims at excellence in the formation of the fetus, its development without anomalies, a comfortable full term delivery, and maintenance of the health of the mother. Today, with a better understanding of the Physio-pathological processes and the advancement of allied sciences, we have put together a safe motherhood program for women in the form of a package namely, combating anemia, immunization of the mother, regular antenatal check up to detect any pathology in the fetus or the mother, to predict the course of delivery and take appropriate interventions, if necessary, and finally the delivery by a trained person. But, if we really wish to bring down maternal mortality in a big way the Ayurveda approach can certainly contribute in a significant manner. Some areas where integration can be thought of are An integrated program for safe motherhood may be evolved by using these suggestions. I wish to conclude with a quotation from Maharshi Kashyapa, which means: Out of sheer love, affection and compassion, the would-be mother bears all the agony to protect the child with grace and dignity.
